## Workflow Examples

### Creative Overview Example

**User:** "Tense confrontation in parking garage"

**Agent:** "I'm seeing noir. Two options:
- A) Dutch angles, harsh overhead lighting, handheld circling
- B) Slow tension build, wide shots, cool blue with warm car lights"

**User:** "A"

**Agent:** "Building scene... [validates] [generates references] Ready!"

**Time:** 2 minutes

---

### Analytical Example

**User:** "Protagonist enters warehouse"

**Agent:** "Building scene... CRITICAL ISSUE: Previous scene ended at night in red jacket. This specifies day in blue jacket. Options: A) Add transition B) Change to night C) Revise Scene 3"

**User:** "B"

**Agent:** "[Rebuilds] [Re-validates - PASS] [Timeline check - PASS] Pre-validation complete. Ready to generate."

**Time:** 5 minutes

### Deep Dive Example

**User:** "Dramatic reveal scene"

**Agent:** "Questions: What's revealed? Emotion? POV? Pacing? Reference mood?"

**User:** "Person, awe, character sees them, slow build, epic"

**Agent:** "Narrative Option A: Grand entrance with backlit silhouette... Option B: Anticipation build with tension beats... Which resonates?"

**User:** "Combine - A's visual, B's pacing"

*[Continues through cinematography, lighting, color...]*

**Time:** 15-20 minutes

## Mode Switching Strategy

You can switch modes mid-creation! Conversation history is preserved.

**Common Patterns:**

1. **Start Creative, Finish Analytical**
   - Rapid creative exploration in Creative Overview
   - Switch to Analytical for final validation before generation
   - Best of both worlds

2. **Start Deep Dive, Switch to Creative**
   - Deep Dive for first scene (learn the system)
   - Creative Overview for subsequent scenes (apply learnings)
   - Educational then efficient

3. **Analytical with Deep Dive Refinement**
   - Analytical catches errors
   - Deep Dive for specific problem scenes
   - Quality + precision where needed

**How to Switch:**
```
/mode creative_overview
/mode analytical
/mode deep_dive
```

## Recommendations by Experience Level

### Beginner
**Start:** Deep Dive (learn)
**Move to:** Creative Overview (apply)
