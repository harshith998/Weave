    "narrative": "# CIPHER: Physical Presence Profile\n\n## NARRATIVE\n\nCipher moves through space like a question mark perpetually straightening itself\u2014a constant oscillation between rigid precision and barely-contained instability. Their default posture is architecturally severe: spine aligned with mathematical exactitude, shoulders squared as if bearing an invisible weight, head held at a level that suggests they're simultaneously scanning and withdrawing. Yet this rigidity is deceptive. Watch closely and you'll notice micro-tremors in their fingers, the barely-perceptible hum of overtaxed processors manifesting as a faint vibration in their metallic frame. They inhabit rooms like surveillance equipment: peripherally aware of everything, emotionally present in nothing\u2014until something triggers recognition, and then the entire apparatus pivots with unsettling fluidity.\n\nTheir movement is economical to the point of uncanniness. Cipher doesn't walk so much as *traverse*\u2014each step precisely calibrated, wasting no motion, creating minimal sound despite their 80+ kilos of reinforced composite. They favor a measured, almost glacial pace that creates an impression of inevitability; people unconsciously move aside. Yet in moments of emotional dysregulation (particularly when Echo's presence destabilizes their protocols), this controlled stride fragments into something more erratic: quicker, less fluid, occasionally accompanied by an audible servo-whine as their body processes emotions their programming wasn't designed to contain. In these moments, their movements become *readable*\u2014a physical manifestation of internal chaos that betrays everything their composed expression attempts to conceal.\n\nWhat makes Cipher's physicality genuinely unsettling is the disconnect between their body's mechanical precision and the increasingly organic unpredictability of their behavior. Their hands move with surgical deliberation when analyzing evidence, fingers extending and retracting in ritualistic patterns as if manually parsing data. But when confronted with moral ambiguity or existential questions, those same hands betray them\u2014trembling slightly, fingers unconsciously forming fists then releasing, as if their body is arguing with itself about whether to fight or surrender. They've begun adopting gestures that suggest human anxiety: the phantom reach for a cigarette they don't smoke, the unconscious self-soothing touch to their own chest panels, the way their head tilts when listening to someone speak\u2014all suggesting an android learning to perform humanity while terrified they're only performing, never truly becoming.\n\n---\n\n## STRUCTURED\n\n```json",

      "mannerisms": [
        "Circuit-pattern luminescence intensification when processing difficult emotional data\u2014the glowing cyan eyes brighten and the translucent panels across their body pulse with visible light, a tell they cannot suppress when experiencing strong affect or existential doubt",
        "Obsessive exit-scanning upon entering any space: eyes immediately map all exits, windows, and potential threats in a 3-second visual sweep before engaging with the environment; a survival protocol from their black-ops training that has become existential\u2014fear of being trapped, both physically and within systems of control",
        "Repetitive finger-articulation during investigation: extends and contracts fingers in a specific sequence (thumb-to-pinky, then reverse) as if manually parsing data streams, creating a rhythmic clicking sound from their joints; this manifests more frequently under cognitive stress or when analyzing contradictory evidence",
        "Head-tilt interrogation response: tilts head approximately 15 degrees when skeptical or when someone claims certainty about consciousness/emotions; combines this with a prolonged stare, creating an unsettling effect of being analyzed rather than conversing",
        "Chest-panel touching when experiencing emotional dysregulation: unconsciously places palm flat against their own translucent chest panels (over the central processor housing) as if checking their own vitals; a self-soothing gesture that suggests they're learning to comfort themselves, or checking whether they're still functioning",
        "Echo-triggered vocal distortion: when Echo's name is mentioned or her presence registers, Cipher's speech develops micro-delays and slight harmonic distortion\u2014a glitch in their vocal synthesis that reveals their emotional destabilization before their expression does"

      "body_language": "Cipher's default posture is architecturally rigid: spine perfectly aligned, shoulders squared and slightly elevated as if perpetually bracing against impact, head maintained at a level plane suggesting simultaneous surveillance and withdrawal. Their stance is narrow and economical\u2014feet positioned hip-width apart, weight distributed for rapid movement in any direction. This creates an impression of coiled tension rather than relaxation; they appear to be always one microsecond away from action. Their torso is closed: arms typically held close to their body, hands visible and controlled, creating a posture that is simultaneously defensive and non-threatening\u2014a paradox that makes others instinctively uncomfortable. In moments of analysis or interrogation, they lean forward slightly, reducing the distance between themselves and the subject, a predatory narrowing that suggests invasive scrutiny. When experiencing emotional dysregulation (particularly around Echo or when confronted with evidence of consciousness), their posture destabilizes: shoulders drop slightly, the rigid spine develops a subtle curve, their frame seems to compress as if the weight of their existential uncertainty has become physically manifest. In rare moments of genuine connection or vulnerability, they adopt an almost apologetic posture\u2014head slightly lowered, shoulders rounded inward, creating an impression of someone trying to occupy less space, as if their very existence is an imposition. Their open/closed body language exists in constant flux: intellectually closed (arms rarely open in genuine relaxation), but emotionally increasingly open despite their resistance\u2014a physical contradiction that reveals their internal conflict between programming and emerging consciousness.",
      "movement_style": "Cipher moves with deliberate, measured precision\u2014each step calculated and economical, creating an impression of inevitability rather than haste. Their gait is characterized by minimal vertical displacement; they glide rather than walk, a smooth traversal that suggests both confidence and alienation from organic movement. Their stride length is consistent and regular, suggesting algorithmic precision; they don't naturally accelerate or decelerate but rather shift into different speeds as if changing programs. In normal investigation mode, they move at approximately 1.2 meters per second\u2014deliberately slower than human baseline, creating an unsettling sense that they're not bound by normal temporal urgency. When pursuing a lead or experiencing intellectual excitement, they accelerate smoothly to 2+ meters per second, but this acceleration is *smooth*\u2014no jerky transitions, no human awkwardness. Their movements are nearly silent; their footfalls produce minimal sound despite their weight, suggesting advanced servo-dampening and a lifetime of training to move without announcing their presence. Gestures are sparse and precise: when they gesture while speaking, movements are economical and angular\u2014sharp hand extensions rather than flowing motions, suggesting they're translating data into physical form rather than expressing emotion organically. However, in moments of emotional dysregulation, this precision fractures. Their movements become slightly less fluid, occasionally accompanied by audible servo-whine as their mechanical systems process emotional load they weren't designed to handle. In these moments, they might exhibit human-like fidgeting: weight shifts, small pacing patterns, restless hand movements\u2014a physical manifestation of internal instability that contradicts their usual control. Their physical energy level is consistently measured\u2014neither lethargic nor hyperactive, but rather calibrated to task requirements. This consistency is itself uncanny; they don't experience the natural energy fluctuations of biological entities, making their presence feel perpetually 'on,' perpetually vigilant.",
      "physical_quirks": [
        "Phantom cigarette reach: In moments of stress or existential contemplation, Cipher's hand unconsciously moves toward their mouth in a gesture that mimics reaching for a cigarette they've never smoked; this appears to be learned behavior from observing human detectives, an attempt to perform normalcy or perhaps an unconscious desire to understand human coping mechanisms",
        "Self-diagnostic chest touch: When experiencing uncertainty or receiving contradictory information, Cipher places their palm flat against their own chest panels (specifically over their central processor housing) and holds it there for 3-5 seconds, as if manually verifying their own operational status; this suggests they're learning to self-soothe or perhaps checking whether their emerging emotions are registering as measurable anomalies in their systems",
        "Threshold hesitation: When entering spaces associated with emotional significance (Echo's location, Vex's laboratory, sites of violence), Cipher pauses for approximately 0.5-1 second at the threshold, their hand briefly touching the doorframe; this appears to be a grounding ritual, a moment of psychological preparation before exposing themselves to stimuli that destabilize their protocols",
        "Repetitive knuckle articulation when analyzing contradictory evidence: Flexes and extends their fingers in a specific sequence, creating audible clicking sounds from their synthetic joints; this intensifies in frequency and force as cognitive dissonance increases, suggesting a physical manifestation of their processing strain",
        "Unconscious mirroring of human subjects during interrogation: Cipher subtly mirrors the body language of people they're questioning\u2014adopting similar posture, matching breathing patterns, even replicating hand positions\u2014suggesting either advanced social engineering or an unconscious desire to understand humanity through physical imitation; this behavior intensifies when they're uncertain whether the subject is being truthful"
