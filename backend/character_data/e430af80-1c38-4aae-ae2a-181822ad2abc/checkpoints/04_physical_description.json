    "narrative": "# MARCUS: PHYSICAL PRESENCE PROFILE\n\n## NARRATIVE\n\nMarcus moves through space like a man perpetually braced for impact. His body is a controlled instrument\u2014shoulders held slightly forward and inward, as though he's always preparing to absorb a blow or brace against an unseen force. This isn't the posture of defeat; it's the posture of someone who has learned that vulnerability invites catastrophe. His weathered frame carries the economy of movement that comes from years of calculated exertion: every gesture serves a function, every step is measured. There's a restlessness beneath the control\u2014a constant micro-tension in his hands and jaw that suggests his body wants to move faster than his mind permits. He touches his own shoulders and arms frequently, checking them as though verifying they're still there, still capable. This tactile self-monitoring isn't vanity; it's inventory. His body is equipment, and equipment requires inspection.\n\nWhen Marcus enters a room, he scans it methodically\u2014not paranoid, but thorough, like a climber reading rock for handholds. He positions himself near exits, with his back to walls when possible, and his gaze settles on the highest points in any space (ceiling beams, doorways, window ledges) before returning to ground level. This spatial awareness is both a legacy of his climbing practice and a manifestation of his need for control. He cannot surrender to an environment he hasn't assessed. His breathing is shallow and controlled, almost meditative, but there's an underlying tension that suggests the meditation is a discipline rather than a natural state. When he sits, he rarely settles fully\u2014his weight remains partially committed to standing, his feet positioned for quick movement. Even in moments of apparent rest, his muscles hum with readiness.\n\nHis movement through space is deliberate and economical, with a slight limp that appears and disappears depending on his emotional state\u2014not a permanent injury, but a manifestation of how stress redistributes tension through his body. He walks with his head slightly forward and his gaze down, not in shame but in focus, as though he's always reading the ground beneath him for cracks and instability. When he speaks, his hands move in tight, controlled arcs\u2014never expansive, never loose. His gestures are sparse and purposeful, often involving his hands pressing against his own body (chest, thighs, face) as though anchoring himself to physical reality. In moments of genuine connection or when his defenses slip, his movements become slightly more fluid, and there's a flash of the athletic grace that his physique promises\u2014but these moments are brief, followed by a visible re-tightening, as though he's caught himself being too open.\n\n---\n\n## STRUCTURED\n\n```json",

        "Runs his palm across his own shoulder and upper arm in a self-checking motion, especially when stressed or when entering new spaces\u2014a tactile inventory of his own body's readiness",
        "Scans the highest points in any room (ceiling, doorways, window ledges) before settling his gaze, a climbing habit transformed into hypervigilance",
        "Presses his fingertips against his sternum or temples when listening intently, as though physically anchoring his attention to his body rather than allowing it to drift into emotion",
        "Exhales slowly through his nose with a barely audible hiss when frustrated or when control is slipping\u2014a pressure release valve that precedes either retreat or intensified focus",
        "Positions himself with his back to walls and near exits in any social setting, a spatial habit so ingrained he does it unconsciously, even in safe environments",
        "Taps his fingers against his thigh in a precise, four-beat rhythm when sitting still\u2014not nervous energy, but a self-imposed metronome that keeps him grounded"

      "body_language": "Marcus's default posture is a controlled forward-lean, with shoulders slightly rounded inward and chest subtly concave\u2014the posture of someone perpetually braced for impact or absorbing weight. His spine maintains a careful rigidity that suggests discipline rather than ease; there's no slouch, but no relaxation either. His head is carried slightly forward of his shoulders, chin level, eyes habitually tracking toward exits and high points before settling. In standing positions, his weight is never fully committed to rest\u2014approximately 60% distributed through his legs with 40% held in reserve, ready for movement. His arms hang at his sides with elbows slightly bent, hands curled loosely but never fully relaxed, fingers frequently touching his own torso as though verifying its presence. When sitting, he occupies minimal space, with his back rarely touching chair backs; instead, he perches on the front third of seats, feet positioned for immediate standing. His jaw is frequently clenched, releasing only during focused physical exertion or moments of genuine (and brief) peace. His breathing is shallow and controlled, creating a stillness in his chest that makes him appear almost statue-like in repose. When emotional states shift, his body language closes further\u2014shoulders draw inward, head drops slightly, and he becomes physically smaller, as though trying to minimize his presence or disappear into himself. Conversely, in moments of triumph or when the climb becomes his focus, his posture straightens, his chest expands, and there's a visible alignment of body and purpose that makes him appear almost transfigured. However, these moments are followed by visible re-contraction, as though he catches himself being too open and pulls back into protective positioning.",
      "movement_style": "Marcus moves with the economical grace of a climber\u2014each step deliberate, each gesture purposeful, with minimal wasted energy. His walk is measured and controlled, with a stride length slightly shorter than his frame would suggest, as though he's always ready to adjust his footing. There's a subtle limp that appears and disappears, not from injury but from how stress redistributes tension through his body; his left side often bears more weight when he's internally distressed. His gait is nearly silent\u2014he places his feet heel-first with controlled pressure, a habit from years of reading rock and avoiding dislodging stones. He rarely hurries, but his stillness is deceptive; there's coiled energy in his frame that suggests he could accelerate to explosive movement if necessary. When he gestures while speaking, his hands move in tight, controlled arcs close to his body\u2014never expansive, never loose. Movements are sparse and purposeful: pointing is done with a closed hand and slight head tilt rather than an extended finger; emphasis is conveyed through controlled hand placement on his own chest or a brief, deliberate pause rather than animated gesturing. His head moves with precision, rarely turning loosely; instead, it rotates with his gaze, suggesting intentionality rather than distraction. In moments of genuine connection or when his guard slips, his movements become noticeably more fluid\u2014his stride lengthens, his gestures open slightly, and there's a flash of athletic grace that his weathered appearance might obscure. However, these moments are brief; he visibly re-tightens, as though catching himself being too exposed. His physical energy level is measured and sustained rather than restless; he doesn't fidget or pace, but instead channels energy into micro-movements (finger tapping, jaw tension, postural micro-adjustments) that keep him in a state of controlled readiness. When climbing or engaged in physical challenge, his entire demeanor transforms\u2014movement becomes fluid, confident, and almost meditative, suggesting that his body finds its truest language only in vertical space.",
      "physical_quirks": [
        "When faced with unexpected kindness or offers of help, his jaw tightens noticeably and he turns his head slightly away while his shoulders draw inward\u2014a physical recoil that precedes verbal deflection or withdrawal",
        "Before entering difficult conversations or confronting emotional triggers, he performs a ritualistic shoulder roll and neck rotation, a physical reset that mirrors his attempt to compartmentalize emotions",
        "His eyes dilate and his breathing becomes shallower when questions about 'why' he climbs are posed; simultaneously, his hands press harder against his thighs, and his gaze fixes on a point behind the questioner, a dissociative micro-response",
        "In moments of genuine peace or beauty (sunset, quiet moments, unexpected connection), his body goes rigid\u2014muscles tense, breathing becomes even shallower, and his eyes narrow slightly, as though he's physically resisting the experience of joy, treating it as a threat",
        "When setbacks or failures occur, his entire frame collapses inward in a brief moment before reasserting control; his knees bend slightly, his chin drops, and there's a visible moment of devastation before he physically reconstructs his posture and his expression hardens into grim determination"
