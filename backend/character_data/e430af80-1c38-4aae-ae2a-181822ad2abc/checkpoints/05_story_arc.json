    "narrative": "# MARCUS: NARRATIVE STORY ARC PROFILE\n\n## NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION\n\nMarcus functions as both **Protagonist and Shadow** in this story\u2014the central character driving the narrative forward, but also the embodiment of his own internal antagonist. His journey is not a traditional redemption arc where suffering cleanses sin; rather, it is a **Disillusionment-to-Integration Arc** where Marcus must confront the false premise that has structured his entire life: that redemption requires self-punishment, and that integration requires choosing between his father's authenticity and his mother's responsibility. The chapel climb becomes the crucible where Marcus tests whether the two halves of himself\u2014the seeker and the dutiful son\u2014are truly incompatible, or whether his belief in their incompatibility is the real fracture he must heal.\n\nThroughout the story, Marcus ascends both literally and psychologically, each physical challenge mirroring an emotional threshold. The climb is deceptively framed as a test of his climbing prowess and courage, but it is actually a test of his willingness to *feel* rather than *perform*. His compartmentalization\u2014his ability to isolate emotion from function\u2014has kept him alive and moving, but it has also kept him dead inside and estranged from Sophie, the one person who might validate his integration. As Marcus climbs higher, the altitude strips away his ability to maintain control through performance; his body betrays his emotional suppression, forcing him to confront what he's been running from: not his father's death, but his own complicity in his mother's prohibition, his wife's estrangement, and his own self-exile. The arc culminates not in triumph or redemption in the traditional sense, but in a moment of **radical acceptance**\u2014the realization that he has been both victim and architect of his fracture, and that integration requires forgiving himself for being human, not for transcending humanity through suffering.\n\nThe transformation Marcus undergoes is neither purely positive nor purely negative; it is a **threshold crossing** where he moves from a state of managed desperation (performing redemption) to a state of managed authenticity (living redemption). He does not become a different person; rather, he becomes *willing* to be the person he already is\u2014flawed, contradictory, capable of both recklessness and responsibility\u2014without requiring punishment as the price of that permission. The chapel, his father's sacred space, becomes the site not of redemption through suffering, but of redemption through acceptance. Whether Marcus survives the climb physically becomes almost secondary; what matters is whether he survives it psychologically intact\u2014not healed, not redeemed in the religious sense, but finally, genuinely *alive*.\n\n---\n\n## STRUCTURED DATA\n\n```json",
