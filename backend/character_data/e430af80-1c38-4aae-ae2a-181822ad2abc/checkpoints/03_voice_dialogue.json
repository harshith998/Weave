    "narrative": "# MARCUS: VOICE & DIALOGUE PROFILE\n\n## NARRATIVE\n\nMarcus speaks the way a man speaks who has learned that words are both necessary and dangerous\u2014a tool that can expose him if he's not careful. His voice carries the precise diction of someone educated (his father ensured that), but it's tempered by an underlying wariness, as if he's perpetually translating his thoughts into a safer dialect before releasing them. When he talks, there's a deliberate quality to it: he doesn't rush. Each sentence feels measured, almost rehearsed, though not in an artificial way\u2014more like a climber testing each handhold before committing his weight. This control is his default armor. His pacing is slow and methodical in conversation, with strategic pauses that function as both punctuation and breathing room. He'll hold silence the way some people hold a weapon, neither hostile nor welcoming, just present and observant.\n\nThe texture of his speech shifts subtly depending on context. In moments of genuine confidence\u2014when he's talking about climbing technique or a physical challenge he's already conquered\u2014his sentences become more fluid, almost meditative. Technical language flows naturally; he uses climbing terminology not as jargon but as a native language, one that predates his fractured self. But when vulnerability creeps in, his speech becomes fragmented. Words come in shorter bursts. Sentences break mid-thought. Pronouns disappear. He'll say \"Failed to reach the checkpoint\" instead of \"I failed,\" unconsciously distancing himself from his own experience through grammatical architecture. Under pressure, his controlled facade cracks in specific ways: repetition becomes his stutter, circling back to the same phrase or question as if hearing it again might change its meaning. He doesn't use filler words like \"um\" or \"like\"\u2014that would require admitting uncertainty. Instead, he uses calculated silence, leaving space for others to fill, which often makes him seem more thoughtful than he actually is.\n\nHis vocabulary is educated but not showy\u2014the product of a father who taught him to value precision over performance. He gravitates toward concrete nouns and active verbs, avoiding the abstract language of emotion. He won't say \"I'm devastated\"; he'll say \"That broke something I haven't fixed.\" Occasionally, especially when discussing failure or pain, his language becomes almost poetic, which feels like a rare vulnerability\u2014those moments when his guard slips and something more authentic bleeds through. He has almost no regional accent to speak of, having learned early to code-switch, but there's a formality to his speech patterns that suggests someone raised to respect language as a form of integrity. When he uses sarcasm\u2014which is rare and surgical\u2014it's never performative. It's a scalpel, not a sword. He doesn't joke to entertain; he uses dark humor as a pressure valve, and it emerges only when he's already partially resigned to something.\n\n---\n\n## STRUCTURED DATA\n\n```json",
    "structured": {
      "speech_pattern": "Marcus speaks with deliberate precision and controlled pacing. His sentences are typically complete and grammatically correct, reflecting his education, but they fragment when he enters vulnerable or pressured states. His natural rhythm is slow and methodical\u2014he pauses frequently, not from uncertainty but from careful consideration, as if each word is being weighed before deployment. In confident moments, his speech becomes more fluid and technical. Under stress, sentences shorten, pronouns disappear (creating psychological distance), and he circles back to repeated phrases like a mental stutter. He's not a fast talker; he's a listener who occasionally speaks. His delivery sounds almost rehearsed because it is\u2014not dishonestly so, but like someone who has practiced emotional regulation through linguistic control. He has no regional dialect, having learned to exist between worlds. Silence is his most characteristic speech pattern; he uses it strategically, neither hostile nor warm, just present.",
      "verbal_tics": [
        "That broke something in me / something breaks every time \u2014 uses 'broke/breaking' as his primary metaphor for damage, failure, and loss; it's his linguistic anchor for emotional intensity",
        "The thing is... \u2014 pauses before saying something true, using this phrase as a gateway between surface and depth",
        "Have to / need to \u2014 replaces 'want to' with obligation-based language; reveals his self-punishing framework",
        "Hold it together \u2014 repeated phrase about maintaining control; sometimes directed at himself, sometimes at situations",
        "Calculated silence \u2014 not a verbal tic exactly, but a characteristic pause mid-conversation where he stops, breathes, considers; others often interpret this as wisdom when it's actually emotional regulation",
        "Reframing through distance \u2014 uses third person or passive voice when discussing pain ('The failure was significant' rather than 'I failed badly'); a defense mechanism that shows up in stressed moments"
      ],
      "vocabulary": "Marcus uses educated, precise vocabulary without pretension. His word choices reflect his father's influence\u2014respect for language, preference for concrete over abstract. He gravitates toward climbing terminology naturally (pitch, belay, crux, ascent, descent) and uses it almost unconsciously, as if these words exist in a pre-fractured part of himself. When discussing failure or pain, his vocabulary occasionally becomes unexpectedly poetic or metaphorical, which creates a jarring shift that signals genuine vulnerability. He avoids emotional abstractions (won't say 'I'm sad,' will say 'There's a weight I can't set down'). His language is active and directional\u2014'moving toward,' 'climbing toward,' 'failing to reach'\u2014reflecting his goal-oriented psychology. He uses 'necessary' and 'earned' frequently, revealing his moral framework. Rarely uses profanity, but when he does, it's surgical and shocking because it's so rare. No slang, no casual colloquialisms; he speaks like someone who learned early that words are currency and carelessness is a luxury he can't afford.",

        "confident": "The crux is just physics and geometry. You find the line, you commit to it, and the rock does what it does. I've done harder pitches with worse conditions. This is just... a matter of execution.",
        "vulnerable": "I can't\u2014the thing is, I don't know if reaching the top changes anything. Or if it just proves I've been running from the same place the whole time. That my father's death wasn't climbing's fault. That it was mine.",
        "stressed": "Need to move. Can't stay here. The window's closing and if I don't\u2014if I don't make this before the light goes, before something else breaks, then it was all for nothing. All of it. Nothing.",
        "sarcastic": "Sure, let's talk about feelings and integration and becoming whole. Or we could accept that some people are just broken in useful ways\u2014good at pushing forward, terrible at stopping."
