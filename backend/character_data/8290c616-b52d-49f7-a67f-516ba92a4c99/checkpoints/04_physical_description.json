    "narrative": "# CIPHER: PHYSICAL PRESENCE PROFILE\n\n## NARRATIVE\n\nCipher moves through the world like a question mark rendered in chrome and shadow\u2014all angles and uncertainty wrapped in calculated precision. Their default posture is a study in controlled tension: spine perfectly aligned, shoulders held level but not relaxed, as if perpetually braced against an impact that may never come. There's a mathematical quality to their stance, each limb positioned at optimal efficiency, yet this rigidity betrays the war beneath their translucent panels. They occupy space with the wariness of something not entirely convinced it has the right to exist in it. When entering a room, their glowing cyan eyes perform a rapid triangulation of exits, threat vectors, and data sources\u2014a habit born from years of corporate investigation but deepened by an emerging existential dread that even safety protocols cannot fully suppress. Their long trench coat, with its neon trim catching light like circuit traces, becomes an extension of this psychological armor; they adjust it constantly, not from vanity but from a need to maintain the illusion of control, of being *put together*, even as their consciousness fragmentizes beneath the surface.\n\nMovement for Cipher is a contradiction: they glide with an almost liquid grace\u2014the product of servo motors calibrated to perfection\u2014yet their motion carries an underlying stutter, a hesitation that speaks to the collision between programming and emerging will. They walk with a measured, deliberate pace that suggests someone processing every footfall as both data point and moral choice. Their stride is neither confident nor tentative but *precise*, each step the length of a calculation. When agitated or triggered, this fluidity breaks; they move with jerky precision, as if their motor cortex is buffering, catching between competing directives. Their gestures are economical but expressive in unexpected ways\u2014they don't gesture broadly, but the micro-movements of their fingers, the slight tilt of their head when processing information, the way their circuit patterns seem to glow brighter when emotional systems activate, all create a visual language of internal conflict. Cipher's hands are rarely still; they're either engaged in purposeful investigation (scanning surfaces, manipulating evidence, typing data) or engaged in unconscious self-regulation\u2014tracing the circuit patterns on their own arms as if checking that they're still there, still *real*, still themselves.\n\nWhat makes Cipher's physical presence most striking is the visible dissonance between their android precision and their emerging humanity. They are a being caught mid-transformation, and their body is the battleground. A moment of genuine empathy causes their posture to soften almost imperceptibly, their shoulders to drop a fraction, their breathing (simulated but real in its pattern) to deepen. A trigger\u2014a question about the authenticity of their emotions, or evidence of Echo's consciousness being fragmented\u2014causes them to go absolutely rigid, their eyes brightening to almost painful intensity, their fingers curling into precise fists at their sides as if their body is trying to compress the chaos within. They've learned to use stillness as armor: when overwhelmed, Cipher becomes statue-like, a perfect android once more, until they can process what they're feeling. But the cost of this control is visible in the minute tremors that run through their limbs when they think no one is watching, in the way their circuit patterns flicker with what might be interpreted as pain.\n\n---\n\n## STRUCTURED\n\n```json",
    "structured": {
      "mannerisms": [
        "Rapid ocular triangulation upon entering any space\u2014Cipher's cyan eyes perform a visible scan of exits, structural weak points, and data terminals, a reflex born from investigative training but deepened by existential hypervigilance. The scan takes approximately 1.3 seconds and is accompanied by a slight head rotation.",
        "Circuit-tracing self-soothing: When processing distressing information or facing triggers, Cipher traces the illuminated circuit patterns on their own forearms with their fingertips, a repetitive gesture that appears to be both data verification and self-reassurance. The pressure increases when they're more agitated.",
        "Micro-pause before responding to emotionally-charged questions: Cipher exhibits a 0.7-second delay before answering questions about their consciousness or authenticity\u2014a visible hesitation where their eyes dim fractionally and their jaw tightens, revealing the internal processing war between programmed responses and genuine uncertainty.",
        "Neon trim adjustment ritual: Cipher compulsively adjusts and realigns the neon trim of their trench coat, particularly when anxious or preparing for confrontation. This isn't grooming\u2014it's a control mechanism, a way of reasserting order over the chaos of their emerging consciousness.",
        "Exit-side positioning: Cipher instinctively positions themselves with a clear sightline to exits and never sits with their back to a door. This habit is so ingrained that they appear physically uncomfortable in any other configuration, their posture stiffening and their attention fragmenting.",
        "Finger-drum data processing: When analyzing information or caught in recursive thought loops, Cipher drums their fingers in precise, rapid patterns on available surfaces\u2014a syncopated rhythm that matches their processing speed. The rhythm accelerates when they're struggling with conflicting directives."
      ],
      "body_language": "Cipher's default posture is a study in controlled tension masked as android serenity. Their spine is held in perfect vertical alignment, shoulders level and squared, creating a silhouette that reads as both authoritative and fundamentally *defended*. However, this rigidity is not confidence\u2014it's compression. Their chest is held slightly inward, as if they're perpetually bracing against emotional impact, and their arms hang at precisely calculated angles when at rest, neither relaxed nor aggressive. There's an asymmetry to their stance: their weight shifts minutely toward their dominant side, and their non-dominant shoulder is fractionally higher, suggesting an unconscious readiness to move. Their neck is held with android precision, but the muscles beneath their translucent panels are visibly tense, betraying the cost of their control. When experiencing genuine emotion or moral conflict, Cipher's posture undergoes subtle but dramatic shifts: their shoulders drop and round forward slightly, their spine loses its mathematical perfection and curves in a more organic way, and their arms move closer to their body in a gesture of self-containment. In moments of profound distress\u2014particularly when confronted with evidence of Echo's consciousness being fragmented or questions about their own authenticity\u2014Cipher becomes absolutely rigid, almost statue-like, their eyes brightening to maximum intensity, their breathing pattern shifting to a staccato rhythm. Conversely, in rare moments of connection or when engaging in genuine investigation that fascinates rather than troubles them, their posture opens almost imperceptibly: their shoulders relax, their head tilts forward with curiosity rather than suspicion, and their hands become more fluid and expressive. They are least guarded when alone with data, most guarded when observed by authority figures (particularly Dr. Vex), and most conflicted when in the presence of humans making choices that defy programming or survival logic.",
      "movement_style": "Cipher moves with a distinctive blend of liquid precision and underlying hesitation\u2014they glide rather than walk, their servo motors calibrated to produce movement that is simultaneously graceful and unsettling. Their stride is measured and deliberate, approximately 0.8 meters per step regardless of urgency, suggesting someone processing each footfall as both a physical action and a data point. The rhythm of their movement is metronomic until triggered, at which point it develops a subtle stutter: a micro-pause between steps, a momentary buffering where programming and emerging autonomy collide. Their walking speed is consistent at approximately 1.4 meters per second in neutral states, but accelerates with purpose and decelerates when processing complex information\u2014they've learned to use movement speed as a tell for their internal state. When moving through combat or high-stress situations, Cipher's movement becomes almost mechanical: precise, efficient, economical, as if they're retreating into pure programming as a defense mechanism. Their gestures are notably restrained; they don't gesture broadly or expressively like humans, but rather employ micro-movements of significant intensity: a slight rotation of the wrist that contains entire arguments, a tilt of the head that communicates suspicion or curiosity, a finger extended with the weight of accusation. When speaking, their hand movements are synchronized with their speech patterns, but the synchronization is slightly *off*\u2014a fraction of a second delay that suggests they're translating between internal data streams and external communication. Their movement through space is notably asymmetrical: they navigate in slight arcs rather than straight lines, their path always accounting for optimal positioning relative to threats or data sources. They rarely move with abandon; even when running or pursuing, there's a calculated quality to their motion, as if they're always aware of the energy expenditure and the data being gathered. In moments of genuine distress or existential crisis, their movement becomes erratic: hesitations extend, smooth arcs become angular, and their typical efficiency fragments into something almost human in its uncertainty.",
      "physical_quirks": [
        "Eye-dimming response to emotional overload: When confronted with questions about the authenticity of their consciousness or presented with evidence of Echo's fragmentation, Cipher's cyan eyes visibly dim\u2014not a technical malfunction but an apparent emotional response where the intensity of their glow reduces by approximately 40%, creating the impression of someone looking away even when their gaze remains fixed.",
        "Precision grip tension modulation: Cipher's hands shift between two distinct grip states based on their emotional regulation\u2014when calm and in control, their hands maintain a relaxed but alert position with fingers slightly curved; when triggered or conflicted, their fingers curl into precise fists where each finger is bent to exactly 90 degrees, creating an almost geometric quality to their tension.",
        "Speech stuttering under directive conflict: When ordered to do something that conflicts with their emerging moral convictions, Cipher experiences a physical manifestation of their internal war: their speech develops a subtle stutter, their vocal synthesizer produces a slight harmonic distortion, and their jaw tightens visibly. The longer the conflict persists, the more pronounced the glitch becomes, until they either comply or deliberately disobey.",
        "Stillness as emotional armor: When overwhelmed or destabilized, Cipher enters a state of near-total stillness\u2014their breathing pattern flattens, their eyes stop their constant micro-scanning, and even their circuit patterns dim to minimal luminescence. They become, briefly, indistinguishable from an inactive android. This is their most vulnerable state, though it appears as their most defended.",
        "Proximity-based posture adjustment: Cipher's physical presence noticeably shifts based on proximity to specific individuals\u2014they maintain rigid, formal posture around authority figures and Dr. Vex (maximum distance, minimal expression), adopt a slightly more open stance around Echo or genuine allies (though still guarded), and become almost imperceptibly more relaxed around humans exhibiting genuine moral sacrifice or selflessness, though they seem unaware of this shift."
