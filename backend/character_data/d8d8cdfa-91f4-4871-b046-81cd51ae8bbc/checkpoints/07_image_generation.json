    "narrative": "Visual Style Profile: Cowboy Bebop style anime - noir aesthetic with dramatic shadows, cinematic lighting, fluid character animation, and atmospheric detail work\n\nGenerated 4 character images for The Man:\n1. Portrait - Close-up headshot capturing their Grim functional numbness with undercurrent of suppressed panic. Externally: controlled, methodical, silent. Internally: constant low-level dread, fragmented thoughts, oscillation between mechanical determination and existential despair. Presents as stoic and resolute; actually operating on fumes and adrenaline with emotional reserves nearly depleted.\n2. Full-Body - Complete physical presence showing their His default posture is a compressed forward-lean with shoulders drawn inward, creating a physically smaller target. His spine maintains a subtle curve rather than straightness, suggesting both exhaustion and defensive coiling. His chest is often held slightly inward, restricting breathing to shallow patterns that keep him physiologically ready for flight. In conversation, his body language is predominantly closed\u2014arms frequently crossed or held close to his torso, rarely gesturing expansively. His head often tilts slightly downward, eyes looking up from beneath slightly furrowed brows, creating an expression of perpetual suspicion. When seated, his legs are never fully relaxed; one foot typically rests flat on the ground while the other is positioned to allow quick standing. His hands remain visible and controlled, rarely touching his face or making sudden movements that might be misinterpreted as threat or vulnerability. In moments of heightened anxiety, his entire frame becomes rigid, muscles visibly tensing as if his body is bracing for impact. Conversely, in rare moments of perceived safety, his posture doesn't relax so much as it becomes slightly less coiled\u2014a subtle difference that suggests true relaxation is neurologically unavailable to him. When experiencing emotional volatility, his body betrays him through involuntary tension: tremors in his hands, a visible pulse in his jaw, and a slight pallor beneath his weathered skin. His presence occupies space defensively rather than confidently\u2014he doesn't command a room so much as he calculates his position within it for maximum tactical advantage.\n3. Action - Dynamic shot showing them in motion, embodying their Unknown\n4. Expression - Intimate close-up revealing their Survival-obsessed pragmatist - views all decisions through lens of immediate threat/benefit\n\nAll images maintain visual consistency with cowboy bebop style anime - noir aesthetic with dramatic shadows, cinematic lighting, fluid character animation, and atmospheric detail work aesthetic, suitable for the Epic, dramatic, intense tone of the story.",

There's a feline quality to his movement\u2014controlled, deliberate, and capable of sudden speed if required.

His gestures when speaking are minimal and close to his body\u2014hand movements rarely extend far from his torso, and when they do, they're angular rather than flowing. He points rather than sweeps, jabs rather than waves. There's no grace in his movement, only efficiency. When climbing or navigating obstacles, he moves with practiced precision, testing surfaces before committing his full weight, a habit born from traversing unstable ruins. His energy level is perpetually restrained\u2014he never appears fully relaxed or fully energized, but rather maintains a constant state of controlled tension. In moments of panic or threat-response, his movement becomes sharp and jerky, all fluid control abandoned for pure survival instinct. When fleeing or moving urgently, his quiet footfalls become almost silent, and his body compresses further, making himself a smaller target. His turning movements are abrupt rather than smooth, his head often preceding his body as he checks for threats.
