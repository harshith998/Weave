    "narrative": "# THE MAN: PHYSICAL PRESENCE PROFILE\n\n## NARRATIVE\n\nThe Man moves through space like a wire stretched too tight\u2014economical, controlled, perpetually coiled. His body has learned to occupy minimal room, a survival instinct from navigating burning rubble and crowded refugee routes. His default posture is a compressed forward-lean, shoulders drawn slightly inward, as if bracing against an invisible wind. There's no relaxation in his frame; even when seated, his muscles maintain a state of controlled readiness, legs positioned to spring upright at a moment's notice. His exhaustion is visible not in slouching but in the brittleness of his movements\u2014each gesture carries the weight of someone who has rationed their physical energy for so long that spontaneity feels like recklessness.\n\nHis eyes are in constant motion, a predatory scanning that betrays his hypervigilance. They dart to exits, to shadows, to the hands of those around him, cataloging threats with the methodical precision his father once taught him to apply to profit calculations. This vigilance extends to his entire body\u2014his head turns frequently, often with a slight tilt of suspicion, as if trying to hear danger approaching from blind angles. When he walks, there's a deliberate quietness to his footfalls, an almost feline quality that speaks to years of learning that noise attracts attention, and attention attracts catastrophe. His stride is neither hurried nor leisurely; it's purposeful and measured, the gait of someone who has learned that panic is a luxury and haste a liability.\n\nWhat's most striking is the tension beneath his skin\u2014a visible tremor in his hands when he thinks no one is watching, a jaw perpetually clenched as if holding back words or screams. His fingers are never truly still; they move in small, repetitive patterns that suggest his mind is constantly calculating escape routes, survival scenarios, the mathematics of staying alive. When unexpected kindness is offered, his entire body stiffens in visible rejection, as if compassion itself is a threat to the fragile architecture of his survival mechanisms. Yet there's also a desperate hunger in how he watches others\u2014a starving man observing a feast he cannot permit himself to consume.\n\n---\n\n## STRUCTURED\n\n```json",
    "structured": {
      "mannerisms": [
        "Compulsive exit-mapping: Upon entering any space, his eyes perform a systematic scan of all exits\u2014doors, windows, gaps in walls\u2014and his body physically orients itself to maintain sightline to at least one escape route. This scanning is involuntary and continuous, even mid-conversation.",
        "Rhythmic hand-counting: When stressed or calculating risk, his fingers perform subtle counting motions against his thigh or palm, a learned habit from his father's early lessons in accounting profit margins. It's a self-soothing mechanism disguised as mathematical problem-solving.",
        "Flinching at fire-sounds: Any crackle, hiss, or popping noise triggers an immediate physical recoil\u2014shoulders tense, breath catches, eyes dilate. His body responds before his mind can contextualize the sound, a trauma-locked reflex.",
        "Jaw-clenching pulses: When confronted with emotion or difficult memory, his jaw tightens in visible waves, muscles working as if grinding words into submission. The tension radiates through his entire face, creating a mask-like quality.",
        "Backward-stepping from kindness: When offered help or shown unexpected compassion, he physically retreats a half-step, his torso tilting away even as his eyes remain locked forward. His body communicates rejection before his mouth can form words.",
        "Nocturnal stillness-avoidance: During moments of enforced rest or safety, he develops repetitive micro-movements\u2014rocking slightly, fingers drumming silent patterns, legs bouncing\u2014anything to prevent the stillness that allows intrusive thoughts to surface."
      ],
      "body_language": "His default posture is a compressed forward-lean with shoulders drawn inward, creating a physically smaller target. His spine maintains a subtle curve rather than straightness, suggesting both exhaustion and defensive coiling. His chest is often held slightly inward, restricting breathing to shallow patterns that keep him physiologically ready for flight. In conversation, his body language is predominantly closed\u2014arms frequently crossed or held close to his torso, rarely gesturing expansively. His head often tilts slightly downward, eyes looking up from beneath slightly furrowed brows, creating an expression of perpetual suspicion. When seated, his legs are never fully relaxed; one foot typically rests flat on the ground while the other is positioned to allow quick standing. His hands remain visible and controlled, rarely touching his face or making sudden movements that might be misinterpreted as threat or vulnerability. In moments of heightened anxiety, his entire frame becomes rigid, muscles visibly tensing as if his body is bracing for impact. Conversely, in rare moments of perceived safety, his posture doesn't relax so much as it becomes slightly less coiled\u2014a subtle difference that suggests true relaxation is neurologically unavailable to him. When experiencing emotional volatility, his body betrays him through involuntary tension: tremors in his hands, a visible pulse in his jaw, and a slight pallor beneath his weathered skin. His presence occupies space defensively rather than confidently\u2014he doesn't command a room so much as he calculates his position within it for maximum tactical advantage.",
      "movement_style": "His walking style is deliberately quiet and measured, each footfall placed with conscious intention rather than casual rhythm. His stride is neither long nor short but economical, covering distance without wasted motion. There's a feline quality to his movement\u2014controlled, deliberate, and capable of sudden speed if required. His pace varies based on threat-assessment: in open spaces with good visibility, he moves with measured steadiness; in confined or shadowed areas, he slows almost imperceptibly, becoming hyperaware. His gestures when speaking are minimal and close to his body\u2014hand movements rarely extend far from his torso, and when they do, they're angular rather than flowing. He points rather than sweeps, jabs rather than waves. There's no grace in his movement, only efficiency. When climbing or navigating obstacles, he moves with practiced precision, testing surfaces before committing his full weight, a habit born from traversing unstable ruins. His energy level is perpetually restrained\u2014he never appears fully relaxed or fully energized, but rather maintains a constant state of controlled tension. In moments of panic or threat-response, his movement becomes sharp and jerky, all fluid control abandoned for pure survival instinct. When fleeing or moving urgently, his quiet footfalls become almost silent, and his body compresses further, making himself a smaller target. His turning movements are abrupt rather than smooth, his head often preceding his body as he checks for threats. Even in stillness, there's movement\u2014subtle weight-shifting, micro-adjustments of stance, as if his body refuses to truly stop.",
      "physical_quirks": [
        "Thumb-tracing of scars: He frequently traces the edges of any visible scars on his hands or arms with his opposite thumb in a meditative pattern, particularly when processing difficult information. This gesture is both self-soothing and a tactile reminder that he survived.",
        "Echo-listening: When hearing unexpected sounds, his head tilts at an angle and his eyes half-close as he 'listens' for threat-context. His body becomes statue-still during these moments, as if sound waves might be missed if he moves.",
        "Grip-testing of objects: When holding anything\u2014rope, tools, cups\u2014he unconsciously tests its structural integrity by flexing and releasing, as if constantly assessing whether objects might fail him in crisis. This habit extends to testing the stability of furniture or structures he encounters.",
        "Breath-holding during vulnerability: When forced into moments of emotional exposure or when receiving unwanted kindness, he unconsciously holds his breath for 5-10 seconds, then releases it in a controlled exhale. His body literally restricts oxygen during moments of psychological threat.",
        "Peripheral-vision preference: He rarely makes direct eye contact, instead maintaining awareness through peripheral vision and quick glances. His eyes track movement in his visual periphery obsessively, and he positions himself to maximize what he can observe without direct attention."
