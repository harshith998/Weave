          "Compulsive exit-mapping: Upon entering any space, his eyes perform a systematic scan of all exits\u2014doors, windows, gaps in walls\u2014and his body physically orients itself to maintain sightline to at least one escape route. This scanning is involuntary and continuous, even mid-conversation.",
          "Rhythmic hand-counting: When stressed or calculating risk, his fingers perform subtle counting motions against his thigh or palm, a learned habit from his father's early lessons in accounting profit margins. It's a self-soothing mechanism disguised as mathematical problem-solving.",
          "Flinching at fire-sounds: Any crackle, hiss, or popping noise triggers an immediate physical recoil\u2014shoulders tense, breath catches, eyes dilate. His body responds before his mind can contextualize the sound, a trauma-locked reflex.",
          "Jaw-clenching pulses: When confronted with emotion or difficult memory, his jaw tightens in visible waves, muscles working as if grinding words into submission. The tension radiates through his entire face, creating a mask-like quality.",
          "Backward-stepping from kindness: When offered help or shown unexpected compassion, he physically retreats a half-step, his torso tilting away even as his eyes remain locked forward. His body communicates rejection before his mouth can form words.",
          "Nocturnal stillness-avoidance: During moments of enforced rest or safety, he develops repetitive micro-movements\u2014rocking slightly, fingers drumming silent patterns, legs bouncing\u2014anything to prevent the stillness that allows intrusive thoughts to surface."

        "body_language": "His default posture is a compressed forward-lean with shoulders drawn inward, creating a physically smaller target. His spine maintains a subtle curve rather than straightness, suggesting both exhaustion and defensive coiling. His chest is often held slightly inward, restricting breathing to shallow patterns that keep him physiologically ready for flight. In conversation, his body language is predominantly closed\u2014arms frequently crossed or held close to his torso, rarely gesturing expansively. His head often tilts slightly downward, eyes looking up from beneath slightly furrowed brows, creating an expression of perpetual suspicion. When seated, his legs are never fully relaxed; one foot typically rests flat on the ground while the other is positioned to allow quick standing. His hands remain visible and controlled, rarely touching his face or making sudden movements that might be misinterpreted as threat or vulnerability. In moments of heightened anxiety, his entire frame becomes rigid, muscles visibly tensing as if his body is bracing for impact. Conversely, in rare moments of perceived safety, his posture doesn't relax so much as it becomes slightly less coiled\u2014a subtle difference that suggests true relaxation is neurologically unavailable to him. When experiencing emotional volatility, his body betrays him through involuntary tension: tremors in his hands, a visible pulse in his jaw, and a slight pallor beneath his weathered skin. His presence occupies space defensively rather than confidently\u2014he doesn't command a room so much as he calculates his position within it for maximum tactical advantage.",
        "movement_style": "His walking style is deliberately quiet and measured, each footfall placed with conscious intention rather than casual rhythm. His stride is neither long nor short but economical, covering distance without wasted motion. There's a feline quality to his movement\u2014controlled, deliberate, and capable of sudden speed if required. His pace varies based on threat-assessment: in open spaces with good visibility, he moves with measured steadiness; in confined or shadowed areas, he slows almost imperceptibly, becoming hyperaware. His gestures when speaking are minimal and close to his body\u2014hand movements rarely extend far from his torso, and when they do, they're angular rather than flowing. He points rather than sweeps, jabs rather than waves. There's no grace in his movement, only efficiency. When climbing or navigating obstacles, he moves with practiced precision, testing surfaces before committing his full weight, a habit born from traversing unstable ruins. His energy level is perpetually restrained\u2014he never appears fully relaxed or fully energized, but rather maintains a constant state of controlled tension. In moments of panic or threat-response, his movement becomes sharp and jerky, all fluid control abandoned for pure survival instinct. When fleeing or moving urgently, his quiet footfalls become almost silent, and his body compresses further, making himself a smaller target. His turning movements are abrupt rather than smooth, his head often preceding his body as he checks for threats. Even in stillness, there's movement\u2014subtle weight-shifting, micro-adjustments of stance, as if his body refuses to truly stop.",
        "physical_quirks": [
          "Thumb-tracing of scars: He frequently traces the edges of any visible scars on his hands or arms with his opposite thumb in a meditative pattern, particularly when processing difficult information. This gesture is both self-soothing and a tactile reminder that he survived.",
          "Echo-listening: When hearing unexpected sounds, his head tilts at an angle and his eyes half-close as he 'listens' for threat-context. His body becomes statue-still during these moments, as if sound waves might be missed if he moves.",
          "Grip-testing of objects: When holding anything\u2014rope, tools, cups\u2014he unconsciously tests its structural integrity by flexing and releasing, as if constantly assessing whether objects might fail him in crisis. This habit extends to testing the stability of furniture or structures he encounters.",
          "Breath-holding during vulnerability: When forced into moments of emotional exposure or when receiving unwanted kindness, he unconsciously holds his breath for 5-10 seconds, then releases it in a controlled exhale. His body literally restricts oxygen during moments of psychological threat.",
          "Peripheral-vision preference: He rarely makes direct eye contact, instead maintaining awareness through peripheral vision and quick glances. His eyes track movement in his visual periphery obsessively, and he positions himself to maximize what he can observe without direct attention."

His speech accelerates under stress and fragments into near-telegraphic phrases. In calmer moments, longer sentences emerge, but they remain architecturally spare\u2014no flourish, no digression. He speaks in present tense almost exclusively, treating past as inaccessible and future as speculative. Sentence structure varies deliberately: sometimes complete and formal (revealing his pre-trauma education), more often broken into functional units. His rhythm is deliberate and measured, with strategic pauses that create discomfort and force others to fill silence. Regional accent is minimal, suggesting either careful erasure or pre-war cosmopolitan background; what remains is the flattened affect of someone who has trained themselves to be unremarkable. In moments of crisis, his voice drops to near-whisper; in rare moments of connection, it carries surprising warmth before he catches himself and retreats.",

        "vocabulary": "Economical and concrete. The Man favors simple, direct nouns (fire, water, road, stone) and active verbs (move, find, survive, take). He avoids abstract concepts and emotional language, though these occasionally slip through when his guard drops. His vocabulary suggests working-class or military background overlaid with fragments of formal education\u2014he can deploy more sophisticated language when necessary (he'll use 'provisions' instead of 'food' in formal contexts, 'expedient' instead of 'quick' when tactical clarity matters), but these words feel borrowed, not native to his current speech. Technical language appears when discussing survival mechanics: navigation terms, weather assessment, injury assessment. Slang is minimal and never casual\u2014it surfaces as a tool, not as comfort. He uses few contractions ('won't' instead of 'will not' feels too committal; he prefers the fuller form), which reinforces his sense of formal distance. Profanity is sparse and devastating when it appears\u2014not reflexive cursing but surgical deployment of obscenity to punctuate genuine extremity.",

The Physician is initially drawn to his trauma (recognizing a fellow survivor or wounded soul) and attempts to offer medical care and emotional support. The Man oscillates between desperate hunger for her guidance and violent rejection of her compassion. He sees in her the mother he failed to protect, which creates both reverence and resentment. Power dynamics shift constantly: she holds authority as an established figure in Rome, but his emotional volatility and survival instincts give him unpredictable control in moments of crisis. There is latent romantic tension born not from attraction but from his need to possess the safety she represents\u2014yet possession is impossible because it requires vulnerability he cannot sustain. Their interactions reveal his capacity for healing touch (learned from his mother) warring with his terror of stillness and introspection.

His choice (whether he protects her or abandons her to preserve himself) becomes the crucible of his character arc.

The Man experiences cautious hope that connection is possible. Crisis Point: The Refugee makes a choice that contradicts The Man's survival code\u2014he prioritizes community over self-preservation, or faith over pragmatism, or vice versa.

          "evolution": "Initial Phase: The Man encounters the Child (perhaps abandoned, perhaps orphaned in the same catastrophe). His protective instincts override his isolationism. He takes the Child under his protection, ostensibly for practical reasons (the Child can help with tasks, or The Man needs purpose), but emotionally he is attempting to resurrect his sister. Mid-Story: The Child begins to trust him, creating vulnerability in The Man. He experiences moments of genuine peace with the Child (rare stillness that should comfort him but instead triggers anxiety about inevitable loss). He may become overprotective or emotionally harsh, cycling between tenderness and distance as he manages his anxiety. Crisis Point: The Child is threatened, endangered, or lost\u2014mirroring the helplessness The Man felt during the burning. His response to this crisis (does he risk everything to save the Child, does he freeze in trauma, does he abandon the Child to preserve himself?) becomes the defining moment of his arc. End-Story: If he saves the Child, the relationship transforms into genuine family\u2014the Child becomes his reason to build a life in Rome, his redemption through meaningful connection. If he fails to save the Child, the relationship becomes a second death, compounding his survivor's guilt and potentially driving him toward self-destruction or nihilistic survival. Either way, the Child becomes the emotional core of his story."

          "type": "antagonist_with_power_imbalance",
          "dynamic": "This figure represents the systems and structures that The Man has learned to distrust. The Authority Figure may be benevolent or corrupt, but either way, they hold power that The Man cannot control\u2014triggering his core fear of powerlessness. The Man's hypervigilance interprets all authority as potential threat. The Authority Figure may attempt to integrate The Man into Roman society (military service, civic duty, community obligation), which The Man experiences as loss of autonomy and freedom. Alternatively, the Authority Figure may exploit The Man's trauma or labor, confirming his belief that vulnerability leads to victimization. The power dynamic is heavily skewed: the Authority Figure has institutional power, resources, and social legitimacy; The Man has only his survival skills and his willingness to use violence. This imbalance creates either desperate compliance (The Man performs obedience while internally seething) or open rebellion (The Man refuses integration and becomes a threat to civic order). The relationship reveals The Man's inability to trust systems larger than himself, his conviction that survival requires autonomy, and his potential for either redemptive integration or destructive resistance.",
          "evolution": "Initial Phase: The Man encounters the Authority Figure as he attempts to establish himself in Rome. The Authority Figure may see potential in The Man (military recruitment, labor, or intelligence) or may view him with suspicion (unknown refugee, potential threat). The Man's initial response is careful calculation: how can he use this interaction to secure resources and maintain freedom? Mid-Story: The Authority Figure either offers genuine integration/opportunity or makes demands that violate The Man's autonomy. If offered integration, The Man experiences temptation toward normalcy warring with his conviction that systems fail. If exploited, his resentment deepens. Crisis Point: The Man must choose between submission to authority (accepting the loss of control in exchange for security and belonging) or rebellion (preserving autonomy at the cost of isolation and potential destruction). This choice reflects his core conflict between pragmatism and freedom. End-Story: If The Man accepts integration, he begins a slow transformation from escapist to citizen\u2014suggesting redemption through acceptance of structured society. If he rebels, he becomes either a legendary resistance figure (transforming his survival into revolutionary meaning) or a hunted fugitive (trapped in perpetual flight). The relationship's resolution determines whether The Man can transcend his trauma-driven isolationism or remains forever locked in reactive survival."

          "dynamic": "This relationship may be literal (someone from his past who survived and finds him in Rome, forcing confrontation with his escape) or psychological (a recurring figure in his nightmares and hypervigilant episodes who embodies his guilt). If literal, this figure may accuse The Man of abandonment, cowardice, or betrayal\u2014articulating The Man's internal accusations toward himself. If psychological, this figure represents the weight of his suppressed grief and the people he could not save. The dynamic is inherently adversarial: The Ghost represents everything The Man is running from, everything he refuses to process. Yet The Ghost is also The Man himself\u2014the part of him that died in the burning city. The power dynamic is inverted from normal relationships: The Ghost has power over The Man's psyche, his nightmares, his triggers. The Man's attempts to control or escape The Ghost are futile because The Ghost is internal. This relationship reveals The Man's deepest wounds and his desperate need for redemption or forgiveness. Key conflicts emerge around The Man's inability to accept that he survived when others did not, his conviction that his survival is somehow theft or betrayal, and his compulsive need to justify his existence.",
          "evolution": "Initial Phase: The Ghost haunts The Man throughout his journey and into Rome. The Man experiences flashbacks, panic responses, and hypervigilant episodes triggered by reminders of the burning. He attempts to outrun The Ghost through constant movement and activity (which is why stillness terrifies him). Mid-Story: The Man's relationships with other characters force him to confront The Ghost more directly. As he allows vulnerability with the Physician, the Refugee, or the Child, The Ghost becomes more insistent\u2014demanding that he acknowledge his guilt, his survival, his losses. Crisis Point: The Man must face The Ghost directly\u2014either through a literal confrontation (if the Ghost is a real person) or through a psychological reckoning (if the Ghost is internal). This confrontation forces him to accept that survival is not betrayal, that he cannot save everyone, and that his guilt, while real, does not negate his right to live. End-Story: If The Man achieves reconciliation with The Ghost, he experiences a profound shift: his survival transforms from shameful escape into meaningful continuation of the lives lost. The Ghost may transform into an ancestor-figure (honored memory rather than accusatory specter) that guides his actions in Rome. If The Man cannot reconcile with The Ghost, he remains psychologically fragmented\u2014perhaps functional on the surface but forever haunted, unable to fully commit to relationships or community. The Ghost becomes the measure of his redemption: can he forgive himself for surviving?"

          "dynamic": "This figure represents The Man's opportunity to transmit his knowledge and experience (learned from his mother) to the next generation. Initially, The Man may resist this role\u2014teaching requires vulnerability, requires trusting that knowledge survives in another person, requires accepting that he is no longer only a survivor but also a teacher/mentor. However, this role also offers him redemptive purpose: through teaching, he honors his mother's memory and gives meaning to his survival. The Healer's Apprentice may be initially wary of The Man (recognizing his trauma, his volatility, his emotional distance) or may be desperately hungry for his knowledge. The power dynamic shifts throughout the relationship: The Man begins with authority (he has knowledge, experience, skills) but gradually becomes dependent on the Apprentice's trust and acceptance. This relationship reveals The Man's capacity to move beyond survival-mode pragmatism into generative purpose. Key conflicts emerge around The Man's difficulty in being patient or gentle as a teacher, his tendency to impose his trauma-survival philosophy on the Apprentice, and his fear that his teaching will prove insufficient (as his mother's healing proved insufficient for his sister).",
          "evolution": "Initial Phase: The Man encounters the Healer's Apprentice (perhaps through the Physician, or through chance meeting in Rome). He is initially dismissive\u2014viewing the Apprentice as naive, unprepared, or too soft for the harsh realities of survival. The Apprentice seeks him out, recognizing in him knowledge and experience. Mid-Story: The Man begins teaching, reluctantly at first. As he transmits his mother's healing techniques and his own survival wisdom, he experiences unexpected satisfaction. The Apprentice's progress and growth begin to feel meaningful\u2014not just survival, but legacy. However, when the Apprentice makes mistakes or shows weakness, The Man's trauma surfaces: he becomes harsh, controlling, or withdrawn (replicating his mother's inability to save his sister). Crisis Point: The Apprentice either abandons The Man (rejecting his harsh teaching style) or confronts him about his trauma-driven mentorship. This forces The Man to examine how his survival patterns are being transmitted to the next generation. He must choose between perpetuating trauma or breaking the cycle. End-Story: If The Man can transform his teaching into genuine mentorship (integrating his survival wisdom with compassion), the Apprentice becomes his redemptive legacy\u2014proof that his survival and knowledge matter beyond himself. If he cannot break his trauma patterns, the Apprentice becomes another casualty of his emotional volatility, reinforcing his belief that connection inevitably leads to harm. The relationship's resolution determines whether The Man can transform from survivor into ancestor-figure."
