    "narrative": "# ALEXIS: NARRATIVE STORY ARC PROFILE\n\n## NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION\n\nAlexis enters the Sistine Chapel as a Protagonist driven by the need to prove his exceptionality through an act of transgressive transcendence. His narrative function is not simply to \"succeed\" at the climb, but to confront the fundamental contradiction between his constructed identity of absolute control and the reality of human vulnerability. The story arc traces his journey from performative invulnerability to a fragile, hard-won recognition of his own mortality\u2014and paradoxically, a deeper sense of aliveness through that recognition.\n\nThe arc begins with Alexis operating at peak performance: charismatic, composed, seemingly in complete command of his body and circumstances. This is his armor, the persona he's built to prove he's not his father\u2014that he can master what his father couldn't. The Arrival and early Ascent phases showcase his calculated boldness, his ability to inspire Cameron's confidence while maintaining emotional distance. He's the visionary who conceived this impossible act; he's the one who dares. But this confidence is brittle, built on the suppression of deeper fears about invisibility, irrelevance, and the terror of being exposed as less capable than his image suggests.\n\nThe near-fall moment becomes his crucible. In that instant of losing control\u2014of experiencing the very helplessness he's spent his life defending against\u2014Alexis faces the shadow he's been running from. This is not a moment of simple fear; it's a collision between his need for absolute mastery and the fundamental truth that mastery is an illusion. The Descent that follows is not a simple recovery but a reckoning: Can he continue performing invulnerability, or has the fall cracked something open? The arc does not resolve this tension neatly. Instead, Alexis emerges from the chapel transformed not into someone who has \"learned his lesson\" about risk, but into someone who has integrated his mortality into his identity. He's still driven, still audacious, still seeking meaning through extreme experience\u2014but now with a deeper awareness that the meaning isn't found in transcending human limitation, but in fully inhabiting it. The Escape is not triumphant in a conventional sense; it's bittersweet, exhilarating, terrifying, and real in a way his previous performances never were.\n\nThis is a **Disillusionment Arc with elements of Transformation and Maturation**. Alexis doesn't become \"safer\" or abandon his need for significance\u2014that would betray his core self. Rather, he's disillusioned of the fantasy that exceptional achievement can make him invulnerable or immortal. He learns that the transcendence he seeks isn't found in conquering fear or defying limits, but in accepting them. This is a painful, incomplete transformation\u2014the kind that doesn't resolve all internal conflicts but deepens them, making him more human and more dangerous in equal measure.\n\n---\n\n## STRUCTURED DATA\n\n```json",
