    "narrative": "# ALEXIS: DETAILED CHARACTER PROFILE\n\n## NARRATIVE BACKSTORY\n\nAlexis grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Newark, New Jersey, where his father\u2014a construction worker with steady hands and an unshakable work ethic\u2014taught him that the world was something to be built, climbed, and conquered through sheer determination. At age eight, Alexis watched his father suffer a catastrophic fall from a scaffold that left him partially paralyzed. The man who had seemed invincible suddenly couldn't climb anything. This moment fractured Alexis's childhood but crystallized a core belief: physical limitation is the cruelest prison, and mastery over one's body is the truest freedom. His father's accident became both a wound and a compass\u2014Alexis vowed never to be confined, never to let fear or circumstance dictate what his body could achieve.\n\nAs a teenager, Alexis channeled his restless energy into rock climbing at an indoor gym, where he discovered an intoxicating truth: the higher he climbed, the more present he became. The noise of his chaotic home\u2014his mother's worry, his father's bitter silence\u2014all fell away. On the wall, there was only breath, grip, and the next handhold. By sixteen, Alexis was competing regionally, winning accolades, but more importantly, he was *alive* in a way nothing else offered. Climbing became his language, his therapy, and his rebellion against the idea that bodies break and dreams die. Yet beneath this drive lurked a darker current: a compulsion to prove something\u2014to himself, to his father, to the world\u2014that he was exceptional, unbreakable, destined for something more than his neighborhood could contain.\n\nMeeting Cameron in college\u2014a fellow climber with a similar hunger but a different wound\u2014transformed Alexis's solitary obsession into something more dangerous and alive. Cameron understood the siren call of the impossible, the seductive whisper that says *we could do what no one else dares*. Together, they escalated from challenging peaks to urban exploration, from legal climbs to increasingly audacious illegal ventures. The Sistine Chapel climb represents the apex of this partnership: a place where art, history, faith, and physical transcendence converge. For Alexis, standing on those walls isn't just about conquering a landmark\u2014it's about touching something sacred, about proving that he's not just surviving his father's legacy but *transcending* it. The climb is his cathedral, his confession, his claim on a life that matters.\n\nYet the near-fall moment during the ascent cracks something open in Alexis. For a heartbeat, he faces the same vulnerability his father couldn't escape\u2014the terrifying reality that bodies *do* fail, that control is an illusion, that mortality doesn't care about determination or will. This moment forces him to confront the question he's been running from: Is he climbing toward something, or away from something? And when he successfully descends and escapes with Cameron, the exhilaration is genuine\u2014but so is the gnawing awareness that no summit, no matter how sacred or dangerous, will ever fill the void he's been chasing.\n\n---\n\n## STRUCTURED DATA\n\n```json",
