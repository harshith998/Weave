    "narrative": "# ALEXIS: PHYSICAL PRESENCE PROFILE\n\n## \n\nAlexis moves through space like someone perpetually ascending\u2014his body coiled with kinetic potential, muscles engaged even in stillness. There's a calculated grace to him, the product of thousands of hours on climbing walls where every movement must be intentional, economical, purposeful. His long hair, often tied back in a high knot or left loose to frame his face, becomes part of his visual language: a deliberate rejection of conformity, a statement of presence. He occupies rooms with an almost magnetic pull, not through volume but through *intensity*\u2014his shoulders back, his spine naturally extended, his gaze always tracking, always assessing. This isn't the relaxation of someone comfortable; it's the readiness of someone who learned early that safety is an illusion and visibility is survival.\n\nHis movements carry an underlying tension born from competing drives: the need to appear effortless and in control, warring against an almost manic restlessness that manifests in constant micro-adjustments\u2014a shoulder roll, a hand repositioned, a weight shift from one foot to the other. When he's confident and witnessed (performing), his physicality becomes fluid, almost balletic; his gestures expand, his stride lengthens, his presence magnetizes. But when doubt creeps in\u2014when someone questions his capability or when he's forced into vulnerability\u2014his body contracts. His shoulders hunch forward slightly, his movements become sharper and more aggressive, his hands clench. The near-fall triggered something primal in him: a loss of mastery that his body still remembers, manifesting now in occasional tension in his forearms and a hypervigilance about handholds and balance.\n\nAlexis rarely stays still. Even seated, there's motion\u2014a leg bouncing with suppressed energy, fingers drumming out rhythms on whatever surface is available, his head tilting to track conversations or movements in his peripheral vision. He touches his own body frequently\u2014not nervously, but possessively, as if constantly confirming his own physicality and control. His hands are powerful and expressive; he uses them to illustrate points, to claim space, and unconsciously to display the calluses and scars that mark him as someone who *does*, who *risks*, who *survives*. There's a performative element to all of it, a deep awareness of being watched, of needing to be seen as capable, as exceptional, as worthy of the space he occupies.\n\n---\n\n##",

      "mannerisms": [
        "Scans room entries and exits within seconds of entering, eyes tracking potential escape routes or vantage points\u2014a habit born from his father's catastrophic fall and reinforced by needing to maintain control in any environment",
        "Habitually flexes and releases his fingers in a specific pattern (thumb to each finger sequentially) when processing information or under stress, mimicking the micro-movements of climbing\u2014a self-soothing ritual that also displays his working hands",
        "Tilts his head sharply to one side when skeptical or being challenged, accompanied by a slight narrowing of eyes\u2014a physical manifestation of his defensive aggression when doubted",
        "Adjusts his hair tie or runs his fingers through his hair before moments of high stakes or performance, a grounding ritual that also ensures he looks visibly composed and intentional",
        "Cracks his knuckles in a specific sequence (starting with thumbs, moving outward) before confrontations, competitions, or when he needs to psychologically 'prepare' for a challenge\u2014a physical declaration of readiness",
        "Unconsciously touches his climbing calluses or scars on his hands and forearms when reflecting on decisions, almost as if consulting physical evidence of his capability and survival"

      "body_language": "Alexis's default posture is upright and expansive, shoulders back and spine extended\u2014a climber's posture that's become his resting state. His chest is open when he's in control, but this can shift quickly into a more guarded positioning (shoulders slightly forward, chest compressed) when challenged or vulnerable. He rarely slouches, even when exhausted; maintaining vertical presence feels essential to his identity. His stance is wide and grounded, legs positioned to allow rapid movement in any direction\u2014he's never fully off-balance. His gaze is intense and directional; he makes deliberate eye contact that can feel confrontational, holding it slightly longer than comfortable to assert dominance or test others' resolve. In relaxed moments with trusted people (Cameron, primarily), his shoulders drop marginally and his jaw unclenches, but even then, his body maintains a coiled readiness. When experiencing vulnerability or loss of control (like after the near-fall), his entire frame becomes more rigid; his movements become staccato rather than fluid, and he pulls inward slightly, as if trying to contain something threatening to break free. His body language shifts dramatically based on whether he's being witnessed\u2014in public or on climbs, he expands and performs; in private moments alone, he sometimes allows a subtle collapse, a brief respite from the performance.",
      "movement_style": "Alexis moves with deliberate economy and grace, each step purposeful and controlled\u2014the product of climbing training where wasted motion is failure. His walk is neither rushed nor leisurely; it's a measured stride with a slight forward lean, as if perpetually ascending. He moves quietly despite his physical presence, his footfalls deliberate and light (a climber's habit of reading terrain). His gestures when speaking are expansive and illustrative; he uses his hands to claim space and emphasize points, particularly when performing or teaching. His movements have a rhythmic quality\u2014there's a musicality to how he shifts weight, adjusts position, and repositions himself in space. When agitated or energized, his movements become faster and more staccato; when calm or in deep focus, they slow and become almost meditative. He rarely fidgets passively; his restlessness is channeled into purposeful micro-movements (weight shifts, shoulder rolls, hand adjustments) rather than nervous tics. His physical energy level is consistently high but controlled\u2014he's like a coiled spring, always ready to release but disciplined about when and how. When climbing, his movement becomes transcendent; his body and mind synchronize into a state of flow where every motion is instinctive and precise.",
      "physical_quirks": [
        "Compulsively checks his grip strength by squeezing objects (handholds, door frames, climbing holds) with his fingers in a specific pattern, testing his own capability\u2014a reassurance ritual that also displays his working hands to others",
        "Bounces on the balls of his feet when standing still for extended periods, unable to fully arrest his kinetic energy; it's subtle but constant, like his body refuses to be static",
        "Touches his chest or sternum when making commitments or speaking about things that matter deeply, a physical grounding point that also draws attention to his core and presence",
        "Performs shoulder rolls and neck stretches before and after conversations involving confrontation or doubt, a physical reset that also extends his frame and reclaims space",
        "Unconsciously mirrors the body language of people he's trying to influence or impress (particularly Cameron), then catches himself and deliberately breaks the pattern\u2014a tell that reveals his strategic, performance-oriented nature"
