Featuring expressive character animation, intense facial expressions during dangerous moments, and fluid movement capture.\n\nGenerated 4 character images for Alexis:\n1. Portrait - Close-up headshot capturing their Elevated alertness masquerading as calm confidence. Alexis operates in a state of controlled intensity\u2014adrenaline is his baseline, not an exception. Externally: composed, charismatic, present. Internally: constantly evaluating, measuring, performing. His default is 'on,' which means genuine rest is rare. After intense experiences, he crashes into brief vulnerability before rebuilding the persona.\n2. Full-Body - Complete physical presence showing their Alexis's default posture is upright and expansive, shoulders back and spine extended\u2014a climber's posture that's become his resting state. His chest is open when he's in control, but this can shift quickly into a more guarded positioning (shoulders slightly forward, chest compressed) when challenged or vulnerable. He rarely slouches, even when exhausted; maintaining vertical presence feels essential to his identity. His stance is wide and grounded, legs positioned to allow rapid movement in any direction\u2014he's never fully off-balance. His gaze is intense and directional; he makes deliberate eye contact that can feel confrontational, holding it slightly longer than comfortable to assert dominance or test others' resolve. In relaxed moments with trusted people (Cameron, primarily), his shoulders drop marginally and his jaw unclenches, but even then, his body maintains a coiled readiness. When experiencing vulnerability or loss of control (like after the near-fall), his entire frame becomes more rigid; his movements become staccato rather than fluid, and he pulls inward slightly, as if trying to contain something threatening to break free. His body language shifts dramatically based on whether he's being witnessed\u2014in public or on climbs, he expands and performs; in private moments alone, he sometimes allows a subtle collapse, a brief respite from the performance.\n3.

Alexis operates in a state of controlled intensity\u2014adrenaline is his baseline, not an exception. Externally: composed, charismatic, present.

His walk is neither rushed nor leisurely; it's a measured stride with a slight forward lean, as if perpetually ascending. He moves quietly despite his physical presence, his footfalls deliberate and light (a climber's habit of reading terrain). His gestures when speaking are expansive and illustrative; he uses his hands to claim space and emphasize points, particularly when performing or teaching. His movements have a rhythmic quality\u2014there's a musicality to how he shifts weight, adjusts position, and repositions himself in space. When agitated or energized, his movements become faster and more staccato; when calm or in deep focus, they slow and become almost meditative. He rarely fidgets passively; his restlessness is channeled into purposeful micro-movements (weight shifts, shoulder rolls, hand adjustments) rather than nervous tics. His physical energy level is consistently high but controlled\u2014he's like a coiled spring, always ready to release but disciplined about when and how. When climbing, his movement becomes transcendent; his body and mind synchronize into a state of flow where every motion is instinctive and precise.\nCurrent Context: Age 26\n\nShot with an 85mm lens in soft natural light.
