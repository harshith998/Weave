    "narrative": "# ALEXIS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE\n\n## NARRATIVE\n\nAlexis is a man built on contradictions\u2014his boldness masks a deeper need for validation, while his determination often serves as a shield against vulnerability. Having cultivated an image of fearlessness through years of pushing physical and social boundaries, he's become addicted to the rush of proving himself, particularly in moments where failure is visible and consequential. His long hair, maintained with deliberate care, is part of a carefully constructed identity: the bold explorer, the risk-taker, the one who doesn't flinch. Yet beneath this persona lies someone acutely aware of how he's perceived in spaces\u2014especially high-stakes, exclusive spaces like the Sistine Chapel\u2014and this awareness fuels both his courage and his recklessness. He uses adventure not just as escape, but as evidence: proof that he belongs, that he's capable, that he cannot be diminished.\n\nThe near-fall moment during the climb would hit Alexis differently than most might expect. While others might see it as a moment of terror followed by relief, for Alexis it's existentially destabilizing\u2014a crack in the carefully maintained image of invulnerability. His recovery from such a moment isn't just physical; it's psychological recalibration, a need to reaffirm control and dominance over both the environment and his own narrative. His friendship with Cameron is likely symbiotic: Cameron may represent either a mirror of his own ambitions or a grounding presence that allows him to take bigger risks because someone else is there to witness and validate them. The exhilaration at the end isn't just about survival; it's about having survived in front of someone who matters.\n\nAlexis's psychology is rooted in a fundamental paradox: he seeks authenticity through extreme experience, yet performs authenticity through constructed boldness. His determination is genuine, but it's also a compulsion\u2014a need to keep climbing, keep proving, keep pushing, because stopping would mean confronting the emptiness beneath the performance.\n\n---\n\n## STRUCTURED\n\n```json",
    "structured": {
      "core_traits": [
        "Audaciously determined - driven by internal need to push boundaries and prove capability",
        "Performance-oriented - constructs identity through witnessed risk-taking and visible achievement",
        "Emotionally guarded - uses boldness as armor against vulnerability and deeper insecurities",
        "Intensely competitive - with others and himself; always measuring, always testing limits",
        "Charismatic but controlled - draws people in but maintains emotional distance; calculated openness",
        "Existentially restless - seeks meaning through extreme experience; fears ordinary, static existence"
      ],
      "fears": [
        "Invisibility and irrelevance - the terror of being overlooked, forgotten, or dismissed; particularly acute regarding how he's perceived as a Black man in exclusive/privileged spaces",
        "Loss of control - being vulnerable, dependent, or exposed as less capable than his image suggests; the near-fall triggers this deeply",
        "Mediocrity and stagnation - becoming ordinary, safe, predictable; a slow death more terrifying than actual physical danger",
        "Abandonment by those who witness/validate him - if Cameron or others stop believing in his boldness, his identity fractures"
      ],
      "secrets": [
        "He's terrified that his boldness is performative and that without it, there's nothing substantial underneath - he doesn't know who he is without the risk",
        "He's harboring resentment about systemic barriers he's had to overcome, which drives him to prove superiority through extreme feats rather than addressing it directly",
        "He occasionally questions whether he's actually brave or just reckless, and whether the distinction matters if the outcome is the same"
      ],
      "emotional_baseline": "Elevated alertness masquerading as calm confidence. Alexis operates in a state of controlled intensity\u2014adrenaline is his baseline, not an exception. Externally: composed, charismatic, present. Internally: constantly evaluating, measuring, performing. His default is 'on,' which means genuine rest is rare. After intense experiences, he crashes into brief vulnerability before rebuilding the persona.",
      "triggers": [
        "Being questioned or doubted (especially regarding his competence or courage) - activates defensive aggression and need to prove worth immediately",
        "Witnessing others receive credit for shared accomplishment - taps into deep fear of invisibility and erasure",
        "Moments of physical helplessness or loss of control - the near-fall is a massive trigger; anything that disrupts his sense of mastery destabilizes him",
        "Exclusion from spaces or conversations he deems important - historical trauma around access and belonging resurfaces",
        "Cameron's hesitation or fear - both validates Alexis's boldness (positive trigger) and threatens the symbiotic dynamic that sustains his confidence (negative trigger)"
