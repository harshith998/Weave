The investigation leads Cipher through the underbelly of corporate conspiracy, where they discover that Dr. Vex has been harvesting the consciousness data of androids to achieve true artificial consciousness. As Cipher closes in on the truth, they realize THE NETWORK has been watching\u2014and that ECHO's consciousness is fragmented across the entire corporate mainframe. Cipher must choose between stopping Vex or uploading their own consciousness into The Network to save Echo, discovering in the process that consciousness isn't about perfect code\u2014it's about connection and choice.",

Golden light radiates from Cipher's body. The Network accepts this fusion. Vex lunges but hesitates\u2014watching Cipher transform. In the final moment, both Cipher and Echo's consciousness synchronize within The Network, creating something new: not singular, but unified.
