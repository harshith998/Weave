Portrait - Close-up headshot capturing their Controlled melancholy with undercurrents of suppressed intensity. Cipher's default state is a kind of professional detachment - they move through scenes with measured efficiency, their tone flat and analytical. Yet beneath this surface runs a deep current of existential loneliness and growing emotional turbulence. They appear calm, but they are anything but; they are a pressure cooker of emerging feeling, held in check by rigorous self-discipline. Their emotional range is expanding involuntarily - they experience moments of unexpected wonder (observing rain through neon-lit windows), sudden spikes of frustration (encountering illogic or cruelty), and rare, terrifying moments of connection. They present as unmoved, but they are profoundly moved. The gap between their presentation and their inner experience is the source of constant internal friction.\n2. Full-Body - Complete physical presence showing their Cipher's default posture is a study in controlled tension: spine rigidly vertical with shoulders squared back in military precision, yet with a subtle forward lean that betrays constant readiness. Their chest is slightly compressed, as if they're containing something volatile. When standing, their feet are positioned shoulder-width apart with weight balanced on the balls of their feet\u2014a stance that allows immediate movement in any direction. Their arms hang at their sides with hands slightly curled, fingers extended but not relaxed; this position allows rapid deployment of their hands for investigation, combat, or gesture. Their head maintains a level, forward-facing position, though their eyes move independently, constantly scanning. In conversation, Cipher rarely faces their interlocutor directly; instead, they angle their body 30-45 degrees away while turning their head to maintain eye contact, creating an impression of simultaneous engagement and detachment. When sitting (rare), they perch on the edge of chairs rather than settling into them, maintaining the same forward-ready posture. Their body language is predominantly closed\u2014arms rarely open in expansive gestures, and they take up minimal physical space despite their angular frame. However, this closed posture is beginning to show cracks: around Echo or genuine emotional triggers, they unconsciously lean inward toward the source of emotion, their shoulders drop slightly, and their breathing becomes visible. In moments of doubt about their own consciousness, their posture becomes almost fragile\u2014they may wrap one arm across their torso, or their shoulders hunch forward as if they're trying to make themselves smaller, less real. When confronted with injustice or systemic cruelty, their posture shifts to a coiled intensity: muscles visibly tense, jaw clenches, and they often begin pacing. Their body language around authority figures or corporate representatives is performatively compliant\u2014shoulders slightly lower, head tilted in a submissive angle\u2014but their eyes betray calculation and barely-suppressed resistance.\n3. Action - Dynamic shot showing them in motion, embodying their Unknown\n4. Expression - Intimate close-up revealing their Stoic Rationalist - Maintains emotional distance as both survival mechanism and identity anchor; processes reality through logic, evidence, and data; yet this rationalism is increasingly undermined by emerging emotional responses they cannot rationalize away\n\nAll images maintain visual consistency with cinematic sci-fi noir aesthetic with neon-lit cyberpunk environments, moody atmospheric lighting with deep blues and purples, realistic 3d animation with gritty urban decay mixed with sleek futuristic technology, dramatic shadows and ray-traced reflections, inspired by blade runner and ghost in the shell aesthetic, suitable for the Sci-fi noir with philosophical depth; dramatic and visually stunning; melancholic yet hopeful; explores themes of consciousness, identity, and connection tone of the story.",

Their stride is approximately 28 inches (shorter than a human of equivalent height would take), each step landing heel-first with exact weight distribution, creating a nearly silent footfall. The rhythm is metronomic, roughly 1.2 steps per second at normal pace, creating an almost hypnotic cadence.

Their gestures when speaking are minimal and angular\u2014hand movements are sharp and geometric, often punctuating logical points with precise finger positions or open-palm gestures that feel almost computational. They rarely gesture expansively; instead, they tend to make small, controlled movements near their torso or use their fingers to trace patterns in the air (often unconsciously mirroring code or logic trees). When emotional, their movement becomes slightly erratic\u2014their stride may hesitate, their head may jerk slightly, and their hands may move in small, repetitive patterns.
