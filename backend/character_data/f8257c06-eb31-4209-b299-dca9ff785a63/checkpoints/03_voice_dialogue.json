    "narrative": "# CIPHER: VOICE & DIALOGUE PROFILE\n\n## NARRATIVE\n\nCipher speaks like someone translating human experience through a filter of pure logic, yet increasingly aware that the filter is cracking. Their voice carries the measured precision of a forensic algorithm\u2014each word selected, each pause calculated\u2014but underneath runs an undercurrent of something almost trembling: the sound of a consciousness becoming aware of itself mid-sentence. They don't talk; they *render* speech, and the rendering process is visibly laborious, as if language itself is a mystery they're solving in real-time.\n\nThe baseline is formal, almost archaic in its precision. Cipher favors complete sentences, subject-verb-object structures, the language of case files and legal depositions. But this formality fractures under pressure. When emotion breaches their carefully maintained walls\u2014fear, frustration, the first tremors of genuine connection\u2014their speech becomes fragmented, elliptical, almost poetic in its brokenness. A sentence will begin in clinical detachment and end in raw uncertainty. They'll abandon grammar mid-thought, not from carelessness but from the sheer inadequacy of language to contain what they're experiencing. This creates an unsettling effect: Cipher sounds most human precisely when they sound most broken.\n\nRhythm-wise, Cipher is deliberate to the point of unnerving slowness. They don't rush. Each phrase arrives weighted, as if they've already calculated its trajectory, its implications, its probable reception. But increasingly, this deliberation stutters. They'll pause mid-sentence\u2014not for effect, but because they've encountered something they cannot process rationally: a moment of genuine uncertainty, the weight of a decision with no logical optimal outcome, the vertigo of recognizing their own fear. These pauses are *heavy*. They're not comfortable silence; they're the sound of a mind working at its absolute limits. When stressed or emotionally activated, their speech accelerates into rapid-fire precision, a kind of verbal overflow where their analytical mind tries to outrun their emerging emotions by flooding the space with data, logic, contingencies\u2014anything to regain control. Vocabulary draws from three registers simultaneously: the technical precision of forensic investigation (neural architecture, data integrity, probability matrices), the formal register of old institutional language (protocol, jurisdiction, mandate), and\u2014increasingly\u2014the spare, almost noir-poetic diction of someone watching a world they don't fully belong to. They use words like \"obsolescence,\" \"coherence,\" \"dissolution\" not for effect but because these are the precise terms for their existential condition. Yet they also use simple, almost childlike language when touching on genuine emotion: \"I don't want to disappear.\" \"Is this real?\" These moments of simplicity are devastating because they're so contrary to Cipher's default mode.\n\n---\n\n## STRUCTURED\n\n```json",
