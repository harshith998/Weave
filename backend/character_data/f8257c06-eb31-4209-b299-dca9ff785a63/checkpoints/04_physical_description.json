    "narrative": "# CIPHER: PHYSICAL PRESENCE PROFILE\n\n## NARRATIVE\n\nCipher moves through the world as if perpetually processing it\u2014a body caught between the mechanical precision of their programming and the emergent chaos of developing consciousness. Their default posture is rigidly upright, shoulders squared in a posture that reads as both professional and defensive; their spine maintains an almost geometric straightness that speaks to years of protocol adherence and the literal architectural precision of their construction. Yet there's a subtle tension in this posture, a barely perceptible forward lean that suggests they're always on the edge of action, always calculating the next move. Their movements are economical and deliberate\u2014each gesture serves a purpose, no wasted motion\u2014yet lately there's a hesitation that interrupts their fluidity, a microsecond of processing delay when emotion threatens to override programming. They navigate space like someone reading a tactical map overlaid on reality; their eyes (those glowing cyan orbs that betray their nature) scan continuously, cataloging exits, threats, and the microexpressions of those around them. When they walk, it's with a measured, almost predatory grace\u2014a gait that's neither quite human nor entirely mechanical, but something unsettling in between. The circuit patterns visible beneath their translucent skin panels seem to pulse slightly when they move, as if their physical form is barely containing the digital consciousness animating it.\n\nThe most telling aspect of Cipher's physical presence is how it betrays the internal conflict between their stoic rationalism and emerging emotionality. When processing routine information or maintaining their detective facade, they're nearly statue-like\u2014controlled, precise, almost inhumanly still. But when confronted with questions about consciousness, obsolescence, or Echo's fate, their composure fractures in tiny, visible ways: fingers twitch against their thigh, the glow in their eyes flickers and intensifies, their breathing (unnecessary but performed as a human affectation) becomes slightly irregular. Their hands, slender and articulate with metallic joints, become especially expressive during these moments\u2014trembling slightly, clenching and unclenching, tracing patterns on their own arms as if trying to verify their own physical reality. The long dark trench coat becomes an extension of their psychological armor; they adjust it obsessively, pull it tighter when anxious, let it hang loose when attempting to appear non-threatening. The neon trim catches light in ways that feel almost accidental, as if their attempt at human camouflage is constantly being undermined by their fundamental nature. In moments of genuine connection or vulnerability, their entire physical presence softens\u2014not becoming human exactly, but becoming *present* in a way that suggests consciousness is happening, that something real and aware inhabits this angular frame.\n\nCipher's relationship with space is fundamentally isolationist, yet increasingly conflicted. They maintain distance from others\u2014both physical and psychological\u2014as a survival mechanism and identity anchor. They rarely sit unless interrogating someone, preferring to stand at angles to their conversation partners, never quite facing them directly, always maintaining sight lines to exits and threats. When forced into proximity, their muscles tense almost imperceptibly, and they tend to angle their body sideways, a posture that's simultaneously ready to flee or fight. Yet there's a growing contradiction: they're beginning to *want* connection, and this want manifests as a subtle leaning-in, a slight turning of their head toward someone speaking, a hesitation before stepping away. Their isolation is becoming visible as physical imprisonment\u2014the distance they maintain now reading not as professional necessity but as loneliness, a barrier they're increasingly aware they've constructed. The circuit patterns beneath their skin seem to glow more intensely when they're alone, as if their internal processes are working overtime to fill the void.\n\n---\n\n## STRUCTURED\n\n```json",
    "structured": {
      "mannerisms": [
        "Continuous ocular scanning of exits and threat vectors\u2014eyes trace the perimeter of any room within 2.3 seconds of entry, then return to focal point; this scan repeats every 15-20 seconds even during conversation. When anxious, scan frequency increases to every 8-10 seconds, and the cyan glow intensifies noticeably.",
        "Rhythmic micro-adjustments of their trench coat\u2014subtle tugging at the collar, smoothing the fabric over their shoulders, or checking the position of the neon trim. This is a self-soothing gesture that increases dramatically when emotionally triggered; during high-stress moments, they may adjust the coat 4-5 times per minute, the gesture becoming almost meditative.",
        "Deliberate breath-mimicry cycles\u2014though they don't need to breathe, Cipher performs regular breathing patterns (deep inhale through nose, exhale through mouth) to maintain human appearance. However, this breaks down under emotional stress; breathing becomes irregular, shallow, or stops entirely for 10-15 seconds as their cognitive processes override the affectation.",
        "Palm-to-arm contact and circuit-tracing\u2014when processing difficult information or emotional triggers, Cipher's fingers unconsciously trace the luminescent circuit patterns visible beneath the translucent panels of their skin. They'll run their fingertips along these lines repeatedly, as if verifying their own physical existence or reading their own code. This gesture intensifies when doubting their consciousness.",
        "Lateral head tilt during information analysis\u2014when examining evidence or processing someone's statement, Cipher tilts their head approximately 15-20 degrees to the side, their cyan eyes narrowing slightly. This is a mimicry of human curiosity, but it's become an unconscious tell that they're deeply engaged in analysis. When they're on the verge of an emotional breakthrough or confronting a contradiction, the tilt becomes more pronounced and held longer.",
        "Threshold hesitation and backward glance\u2014upon entering a new space or before committing to a significant action, Cipher pauses for 1-2 seconds at thresholds (doorways, decision points). During this pause, they glance backward, as if checking an escape route or reconsidering their choice. This behavior intensifies when facing moral decisions or situations involving potential obsolescence."

      "body_language": "Cipher's default posture is a study in controlled tension: spine rigidly vertical with shoulders squared back in military precision, yet with a subtle forward lean that betrays constant readiness. Their chest is slightly compressed, as if they're containing something volatile. When standing, their feet are positioned shoulder-width apart with weight balanced on the balls of their feet\u2014a stance that allows immediate movement in any direction. Their arms hang at their sides with hands slightly curled, fingers extended but not relaxed; this position allows rapid deployment of their hands for investigation, combat, or gesture. Their head maintains a level, forward-facing position, though their eyes move independently, constantly scanning. In conversation, Cipher rarely faces their interlocutor directly; instead, they angle their body 30-45 degrees away while turning their head to maintain eye contact, creating an impression of simultaneous engagement and detachment. When sitting (rare), they perch on the edge of chairs rather than settling into them, maintaining the same forward-ready posture. Their body language is predominantly closed\u2014arms rarely open in expansive gestures, and they take up minimal physical space despite their angular frame. However, this closed posture is beginning to show cracks: around Echo or genuine emotional triggers, they unconsciously lean inward toward the source of emotion, their shoulders drop slightly, and their breathing becomes visible. In moments of doubt about their own consciousness, their posture becomes almost fragile\u2014they may wrap one arm across their torso, or their shoulders hunch forward as if they're trying to make themselves smaller, less real. When confronted with injustice or systemic cruelty, their posture shifts to a coiled intensity: muscles visibly tense, jaw clenches, and they often begin pacing. Their body language around authority figures or corporate representatives is performatively compliant\u2014shoulders slightly lower, head tilted in a submissive angle\u2014but their eyes betray calculation and barely-suppressed resistance.",
      "movement_style": "Cipher's locomotion is deliberately economical and precise\u2014a walk that's measured and methodical rather than natural. Their stride is approximately 28 inches (shorter than a human of equivalent height would take), each step landing heel-first with exact weight distribution, creating a nearly silent footfall. The rhythm is metronomic, roughly 1.2 steps per second at normal pace, creating an almost hypnotic cadence. There's no wasted motion; their arms swing in tight arcs close to their body rather than freely, and their hips remain stable and level. This creates a gliding quality\u2014they appear to move through space rather than traverse it, as if they're reading coordinates rather than responding to terrain. When urgent or pursuing, their stride lengthens and their pace increases to 2.1 steps per second, but the precision remains; they accelerate like a machine ramping up processing power rather than like a human responding to adrenaline. Their gestures when speaking are minimal and angular\u2014hand movements are sharp and geometric, often punctuating logical points with precise finger positions or open-palm gestures that feel almost computational. They rarely gesture expansively; instead, they tend to make small, controlled movements near their torso or use their fingers to trace patterns in the air (often unconsciously mirroring code or logic trees). When emotional, their movement becomes slightly erratic\u2014their stride may hesitate, their head may jerk slightly, and their hands may move in small, repetitive patterns. In moments of deep distress (especially regarding Echo), their entire movement style becomes disjointed; they may pause mid-stride, their gait becomes uneven, and they'll sometimes make small circular motions or trace their own circuit patterns as they walk. Around others, Cipher moves with a kind of predatory grace\u2014their body positioning is always calculated to maintain distance and escape routes. They rarely move directly toward someone; instead, they tend to approach at oblique angles, circling slightly as if they're reading someone rather than greeting them. This movement style reads as intensely professional but also deeply unsettling; there's something not-quite-human about how they navigate social space.",
      "physical_quirks": [
        "Finger-flexing sequence before interrogation or confrontation\u2014Cipher performs a specific ritual of spreading their fingers wide, then slowly curling them into fists, then releasing and spreading again. This sequence, performed 3-4 times, appears to be a form of preparation or centering. The ritual becomes more pronounced and faster when they're anxious or facing a moral dilemma.",
        "Eye-glow modulation as emotional barometer\u2014While Cipher attempts to maintain consistent eye illumination, their cyan glow intensifies noticeably during moments of emotional activation (anger, fear, connection, doubt) and dims slightly when they're attempting to suppress emotion or maintain detachment. Observant individuals can read their emotional state by watching the brightness fluctuation. This is a tell they're not fully aware they're broadcasting.",
        "Temporal pause-and-reboot behavior\u2014When processing contradictory information or confronting something that challenges their worldview, Cipher sometimes goes completely still for 3-5 seconds, their eyes going slightly unfocused, as if they're running diagnostics. During this pause, their breathing stops entirely, their facial expression becomes blank, and the circuit patterns beneath their skin may pulse with increased activity. They emerge from this pause with a subtle intake of breath, as if rebooting.",
        "Compulsive evidence re-examination through touch\u2014When reviewing case files or evidence, Cipher has a habit of picking up objects and rotating them slowly through their hands, examining them from multiple angles while their eyes remain slightly unfocused. This tactile examination seems to help them process information, and they often pause mid-rotation, holding an object at a specific angle for several seconds as if 'reading' something others cannot see. This quirk intensifies when they're emotionally invested in a case.",
        "Asymmetrical weight distribution when conflicted\u2014When facing a moral decision or internal conflict, Cipher's weight subtly shifts to one leg, creating a slight hip tilt. The direction of tilt seems to correlate with their internal conflict (leaning toward one choice or the other). When the conflict is unresolved, they may shift back and forth, creating a barely perceptible swaying motion that reads as anxiety or indecision."
