    "narrative": "# ALEXIS: PHYSICAL PRESENCE PROFILE\n\n## NARRATIVE\n\nAlexis moves through space like someone perpetually auditioning for a role he's already cast himself in. His physicality is a carefully orchestrated performance of capability\u2014every gesture calculated to project mastery, yet underneath runs a current of restless tension that betrays the constant self-monitoring. He inherited his mother's performer's awareness of how bodies occupy attention; he watches himself being watched, even when alone. This hypervigilance manifests as a controlled, almost economical movement style: nothing wasted, nothing accidental. His long hair becomes part of this choreography\u2014he uses it strategically, a toss of the head to punctuate confidence, a sweep across his shoulder when regrouping after uncertainty. But there's a brittleness to this control. When dismissed or doubted, his movements become sharper, more aggressive; he'll take on physical challenges with an almost punitive intensity, as if his body must prove what his worth cannot. His father's chronic pain from the construction accident lives in Alexis's body as a phantom fear\u2014he moves with the unconscious awareness of someone terrified of becoming immobilized, of his physical form betraying him. This drives a paradoxical physicality: he pushes his body to extremes to prove it won't fail him, yet carries an underlying dread that one day it will. In intimate moments with Cameron, his carefully constructed posture softens slightly; his movements become less performative and more genuine. But the moment criticism enters, his walls rebuild instantly\u2014his spine straightens, his jaw tightens, and he defaults back to the invulnerable version of himself.\n\nHis spatial awareness is acute and defensive. He positions himself strategically in rooms\u2014always noting exits, always maintaining sightlines, always aware of who has authority or advantage in the space. This isn't paranoia; it's the learned behavior of someone whose identity depends on never being caught off-guard. When climbing, this translates into meticulous movement\u2014each handhold tested, each footfall deliberate. But in social situations, the same hypervigilance creates a subtle tension in his shoulders and neck, a readiness that never fully dissipates. His hands are rarely still; they gesture expressively when he's engaged and confident, but when threatened or uncertain, they become tools of distraction\u2014fidgeting, adjusting, controlling. He uses his hands to maintain dominance in conversation, often gesturing in ways that subtly claim space or redirect attention. His breathing is controlled but shallow when stressed; he's learned to regulate it as a form of emotional management, which means his chest rarely rises and falls naturally\u2014it's another performance, another mechanism of control. Even his rest is active; Alexis doesn't truly relax. He dozes rather than sleeps deeply, alert to potential threats or opportunities. His body language says: *I am capable, I am in control, I am worthy of attention*\u2014but his nervous system constantly whispers the opposite.\n\n---\n\n## STRUCTURED\n\n```json",

      "mannerisms": [
        "Sweeps long hair across shoulder with deliberate precision when regrouping after a moment of uncertainty\u2014a reset gesture that physically repositions confidence; does this even when alone, suggesting it's internalized rather than purely performative",
        "Scans room exits and authority figures upon entering any space; eyes move in a practiced pattern (door, windows, faces, exits) within the first 3 seconds\u2014a learned behavior that's become automatic, betraying his need to never be trapped or blindsided",
        "Tilts chin slightly upward and locks jaw when receiving criticism or dismissal; holds this position for 2-3 seconds before responding, as if physically bracing against an impact; the gesture reads as defiant but masks acute vulnerability",
        "Taps the inside of his wrist (pulse point) rhythmically with his index finger when in extended conversation\u2014a subtle self-soothing gesture disguised as casual fidgeting; increases frequency when discussing his accomplishments or defending his choices",
        "Cracks knuckles or rolls shoulders in a specific sequence (left shoulder, right shoulder, both hands) before attempting something high-stakes or when challenged; treats it as a ritual preparation, as if physically loading himself for performance",
        "Maintains deliberate eye contact slightly longer than comfortable during important moments, as if trying to bore through the other person's skepticism; blinks slowly and infrequently, which creates an unsettling intensity that reads as either confidence or aggression depending on context"

      "body_language": "Alexis's default posture is an interesting contradiction: his spine is straight and his shoulders are pulled back, projecting confidence and authority, yet there's a subtle tension held throughout his frame that prevents true relaxation. His chest is open but his shoulders are slightly elevated, suggesting constant low-level vigilance. When standing, he distributes weight evenly but keeps his feet positioned for quick movement\u2014never flat-footed or settled. His head is typically held level or tilted slightly forward, as if perpetually assessing. In sitting, he rarely settles into furniture; instead, he perches with his back not fully against the chair, maintaining an escape route. His hands rest on his thighs or table edge, never truly limp. When engaged in conversation with peers or equals, his body language opens\u2014chest forward, gestures expansive, taking up space. But when in situations where his competence might be questioned, his frame becomes more controlled; movements become precise, almost surgical. His body language shifts dramatically with emotional states: dismissal triggers an immediate stiffening of the neck and a forward lean (aggressive readiness); doubt triggers a brief closing inward before compensatory expansion; Cameron's criticism causes a visible flinch followed by rigid control\u2014his jaw clenches, his breathing becomes shallow, and he'll often stand or pace to regain physical authority. When physically vulnerable (tired, injured, ill), he becomes hyperaware of his posture and unconsciously exaggerates his confidence markers\u2014straighter spine, more deliberate movements\u2014as if fighting against the visibility of weakness. His body language fundamentally communicates: *I am in control* while his nervous system broadcasts: *I must prove I'm in control*.",
      "movement_style": "Alexis moves with practiced efficiency\u2014his gait is measured and deliberate, neither rushed nor leisurely, with a stride length that's slightly longer than average, suggesting forward momentum and purpose. His movement has a rhythmic quality, almost musical; there's a grace inherited from his mother's performer lineage, but it's been hardened into something more controlled and masculine. He walks with his shoulders relatively still, most movement generated from the hips and legs, which creates an economical, almost predatory quality. His pace varies strategically: he moves quickly when entering spaces to establish dominance, slows deliberately when listening (a subtle power move that says *I am not rushed*), and accelerates when challenged or uncertain (a subconscious attempt to outrun doubt). When climbing, his movement becomes poetry\u2014each gesture precise, weight distributed with mathematical awareness, movements flowing from one hold to the next with minimal wasted motion. His gestures when talking are expansive and expressive, using his whole arm and hand to punctuate points, especially when discussing his accomplishments or defending his choices. When stressed or in confrontation, his gestures become sharper and more angular, cutting through air rather than flowing through it. His hands move frequently\u2014gesturing, adjusting, touching his own body\u2014which serves multiple functions: it channels nervous energy, it maintains visual focus and dominance in conversation, and it creates a sense of controlled chaos that prevents others from fully reading him. He rarely moves in straight lines; instead, there's always a subtle curve or angle to his trajectory, as if he's always positioning himself strategically. In moments of genuine rest (rare), his movements become slower and more fluid, but even then there's an underlying tension\u2014his body never fully surrenders. His physical energy level is consistently high; he's a person in motion even when stationary, with fidgeting, adjusting, and repositioning creating a sense of kinetic readiness.",
      "physical_quirks": [
        "Runs his index and middle finger along the edge of his jaw\u2014from chin to ear\u2014when processing information or making decisions; the gesture is meditative but also serves to check his own tension level, feeling for clenching; increases frequency when uncertain but trying to appear confident",
        "Adjusts his hair obsessively during moments of self-doubt, using it as a physical reset button; will sweep it back, retie it, or let it fall in different configurations as a way of literally repositioning his sense of self; the gesture reads as vanity but functions as anxiety management",
        "Grips the edge of tables, climbing holds, or Cameron's hand with slightly more pressure than necessary\u2014a subconscious attempt to maintain control and connection simultaneously; releases suddenly when aware of it, as if caught revealing too much",
        "Breathes in specific patterns during high-stress moments: inhales sharply through the nose, holds for a count of 4, exhales slowly through the mouth; learned this as emotional regulation but it also serves to demonstrate control to observers, making even his breathing performative",
        "Stands or paces immediately after receiving criticism or doubt, unable to remain seated; the movement serves to regain physical authority and process the emotional impact; will often touch walls or fixtures as he paces, grounding himself through tactile contact"
