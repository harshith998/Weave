    "narrative": "# ALEXIS: PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE\n\n## NARRATIVE\n\nAlexis is a man constructed from contradictions\u2014someone who appears fearless on the surface but is actually driven by a deep need to prove his existence matters. His boldness isn't recklessness; it's a carefully calibrated rebellion against invisibility. Growing up as a Black man in spaces where he was often overlooked or stereotyped, Alexis learned early that passivity meant erasure. His determination became armor, his audacity became voice. Yet beneath this performance of confidence lies a perfectionist who catastrophizes privately\u2014he replays moments of doubt in solitude, questioning whether his boldness is genuine courage or elaborate compensation for profound insecurity.\n\nThe Sistine Chapel climb represents more than adventure for Alexis; it's a metaphorical ascension toward significance. He chooses extreme experiences not merely for thrills, but to create moments where he cannot be ignored, where his presence becomes undeniable. His partnership with Cameron is crucial\u2014it's both genuine camaraderie and a subtle competition, a way to validate his worth through shared witness. When danger strikes (the near-fall), his response reveals his core conflict: he experiences terror not primarily of death, but of failing, of proving that his boldness was hubris all along. His exhilaration upon escape isn't just adrenaline; it's vindication. He survived. He proved something. He mattered.\n\nWhat Alexis doesn't fully acknowledge is that this cycle\u2014seeking validation through increasingly dangerous feats\u2014is unsustainable and rooted in a wound he hasn't examined. His long hair, meticulously maintained despite the adventuring lifestyle, is both an aesthetic choice and a reclamation of identity, a refusal to conform to expectations. Everything about him is intentional, controlled, strategic\u2014except his emotional vulnerability, which he experiences as a terrifying loss of control.\n\n---\n\n## STRUCTURED\n\n```json",

      "emotional_baseline": "Controlled intensity\u2014Alexis operates in a state of managed adrenaline, appearing calm and focused externally while experiencing constant internal pressure to perform and prove. His default is engaged watchfulness, reading situations and people for validation or threat. He alternates between exhilaration (during high-stakes moments) and hollow exhaustion (in quiet moments), rarely settling into genuine peace. His emotional range is wide but heavily filtered through his need to maintain the image of invulnerability.",

        "Symbols of ordinariness or invisibility\u2014ordinary jobs, conventional paths, anonymity; these trigger existential anxiety and compulsive urge to pursue the extraordinary",
        "Physical limitation or vulnerability\u2014illness, injury, or moments of genuine weakness trigger shame and desperate compensation through subsequent risk-taking"
