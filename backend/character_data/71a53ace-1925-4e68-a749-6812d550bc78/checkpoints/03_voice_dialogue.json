    "narrative": "# ALEXIS: VOICE & DIALOGUE PROFILE\n\n## NARRATIVE\n\nAlexis speaks with the controlled precision of someone who has learned that every word is a calculated move. His voice carries an underlying tension\u2014a tautness that suggests he's perpetually braced for the next test, the next judgment. He doesn't ramble; he constructs. When confident, his sentences are clean and assured, each one landing with deliberate weight. But beneath that architectural precision lies a current of barely-contained intensity. He pauses frequently\u2014not from uncertainty, but from *editing*\u2014catching himself mid-thought, deciding what serves his image and what doesn't. There's a performative quality to his speech; he's always slightly aware of how his words land, adjusting his tone like a climber adjusting their grip. His vocabulary oscillates between technical precision (climbing terminology, risk analysis, psychological concepts) and stark, almost blunt simplicity when he's being honest. He rarely uses filler words like \"um\" or \"like\"\u2014they feel like slips in the facade\u2014but he does use deliberate pauses and incomplete sentences as a rhetorical device, leaving space for others to fill, to prove they're paying attention.\n\nWhen vulnerable, his speech fractures. The architecture collapses into fragments. He speaks more slowly, with longer pauses between thoughts, as if each word requires negotiation with himself. His vocabulary contracts\u2014fewer technical terms, more visceral language. He might repeat words or phrases unconsciously, a verbal stutter born from the effort of saying something true. His sarcasm becomes sharper, more self-directed, cutting himself off before others can. Under pressure\u2014during climbs, in moments of real danger\u2014his speech compresses into something almost terse, commands and observations stripped to their essence. The controlled intensity transforms into pure focus; words become functional, almost instrumental. He speaks in imperatives and present-tense observations: *\"Repoint left. Pressure's good. Next hold.\"* His sarcasm is his deflection mechanism, deployed when he's protecting something raw, when the gap between his performed invulnerability and his actual doubt feels too exposed.\n\nHis speech is fundamentally shaped by his need to be *seen* without being truly *known*. He speaks as if always aware of an audience\u2014even in private moments, there's a subtle performance quality. He uses language to establish competence, to demonstrate mastery, to leave no room for dismissal. Yet paradoxically, his most authentic moments come when he drops the performance entirely, when exhaustion or genuine connection makes the facade unsustainable. In those moments, his voice becomes almost vulnerable in its simplicity\u2014direct, without armor, briefly human rather than aspirational.\n\n---\n\n## STRUCTURED\n\n```json",
    "structured": {
      "speech_pattern": "Alexis speaks with formal precision layered over intense undercurrents. His default is measured and architectural\u2014complete sentences, strategic word choice, deliberate pacing. He constructs thoughts rather than streams them. Sentence structure is primarily complex but controlled; he uses fragments intentionally for emphasis, never accidentally. His rhythm is deliberate with significant pauses\u2014not hesitations, but editorial moments where he's deciding what to reveal. He speaks slowly enough to command attention, fast enough to convey controlled urgency. In high-stakes moments, his speech compresses into terse observations and commands. In vulnerable moments, fragmentation increases\u2014incomplete thoughts, repetition, longer pauses. His accent is neutral, carefully cultivated; any regional markers have been deliberately smoothed away, suggesting someone who learned early that distinctiveness could be liability. In casual moments with trusted people, his speech relaxes slightly but never becomes truly casual\u2014the precision remains, just with slightly more oxygen around it. The contrast between his public and private voice is subtle but present: publicly, he's more declarative and image-conscious; privately, he's more questioning and self-aware, though still filtered through his need to maintain control.",
      "verbal_tics": [
        "Repeats key phrases for emphasis: 'The thing is' (often used when pivoting to something he's decided to be honest about)",
        "Deliberate pauses mid-sentence, leaving silence as a rhetorical device\u2014forces listeners to sit with discomfort",
        "Uses 'Listen' not as filler but as a demand for attention, usually preceding something he considers important",
        "Self-interruption with 'No, wait\u2014' when he catches himself saying something too revealing, then recalibrates",
        "Refers to himself in third person during moments of detachment or self-protection: 'Alexis knows better than that' instead of 'I know'",
        "Asks rhetorical questions when deflecting from vulnerability: 'What did you expect?' or 'You think I haven't considered that?'"
      ],
      "vocabulary": "Alexis's vocabulary reflects both his intellectual engagement and his performative sophistication. He uses technical climbing terminology with ease (crux, belay, anchor, sequencing, onsight, flash) and extends this precision to psychological concepts (compartmentalization, risk mitigation, threshold, leverage). His education is evident\u2014he uses words like 'audacious,' 'nexus,' 'existential,' 'counterphobic'\u2014but never ostentatiously. These words emerge naturally, suggesting someone who reads widely and thinks deeply. He favors active verbs over passive constructions; things don't *happen to him*, he *pursues* or *confronts* them. When emotional, his vocabulary becomes more visceral and simple: 'hollow,' 'raw,' 'fractured,' 'burning.' He rarely uses colloquialisms or slang, which itself is a marker of his carefully maintained distance. Modern expressions are used sparingly and deliberately. Old-fashioned or classical phrases appear occasionally, suggesting influences beyond his immediate context. His word choice shifts in different contexts: with climbing partners, he's more technical; with people he's trying to impress, more articulate; with people he trusts, more direct and less adorned.",

        "confident": "The route isn't difficult\u2014it's just *specific*. You have to understand what it's asking for, and then you give it exactly what it wants. No negotiation, no improvisation. Precision or failure.",
        "vulnerable": "I... I don't know if I'm actually good at this or just terrified of being ordinary. And I can't tell which fear is driving me anymore. Maybe they're the same fear.",
        "stressed": "Repoint left. Pressure's holding. Don't think\u2014just move. Focus on the next hold, not the summit. Next hold.",
        "sarcastic": "Oh sure, let's just climb the Sistine Chapel on a Wednesday. What could possibly go wrong? Besides everything. Absolutely everything could go wrong."
