    "narrative": "# MAYA CHEN: RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS PROFILE\n\n## NARRATIVE\n\nMaya Chen's relational architecture is built on the same principle she applies to data: minimal input, maximum control. She has engineered her life to require as few emotional dependencies as possible, creating what she experiences as safety but others might recognize as profound isolation. Her relationships are compartmentalized like her psyche\u2014each person exists in a separate file, accessed on specific terms, with strict boundaries on emotional access. She is capable of genuine warmth and intellectual intimacy, but these moments terrify her because they threaten her carefully maintained independence. What makes Maya's relational patterns particularly complex is that her gift\u2014seeing probability timelines\u2014fundamentally destabilizes her need for control. When she encounters someone who also shares this ability, or someone who refuses to be categorized and controlled, her entire relational system begins to fracture.\n\nHer past has taught her that connection is a liability. Watching her father's cognitive dissolution while she was unable to prevent or fix it created a core belief: loving someone means being complicit in their suffering. Her brief romantic connection with James Okonkwo reinforced this\u2014he needed her in ways that made her feel responsible for his emotional survival, a burden she experienced as suffocation. These experiences have created a paradoxical pattern: Maya desperately seeks connection (her fear of irrelevance demands that she matter to someone) while simultaneously sabotaging it (her fear of loss demands that she need no one). She attracts people who recognize her brilliance and want to draw her closer, but she has finely honed techniques for creating distance\u2014intellectual superiority, selective vulnerability that maintains control, strategic honesty that re-establishes her solitude.\n\nThe introduction of the child with her gift and Dr. Elias Venn's persistent pursuit of her creates a relational crucible. For the first time, Maya cannot control the terms of connection. The child's vulnerability triggers her most dangerous trigger\u2014helplessness in the face of suffering\u2014forcing her to act in ways that violate her core need for independence. Dr. Venn's obsessive interest in her gift reframes her as a subject to be studied rather than a person to be known, which triggers her rage-shame response to being patronized. These relationships will force Maya to choose between her survival strategy (isolation) and her survival need (mattering to someone). Her arc will not be about learning to trust easily, but about learning that some connections are worth the loss of control.\n\n---\n\n## STRUCTURED DATA\n\n```json",
