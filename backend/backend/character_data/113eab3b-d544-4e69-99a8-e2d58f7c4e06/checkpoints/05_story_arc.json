    "narrative": "# MAYA CHEN: NARRATIVE STORY ARC PROFILE\n\n## NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION\n\nMaya Chen's arc is fundamentally a **Positive Change Arc with Shadow Integration**\u2014she transforms from a woman who treats her own consciousness as a problem to be solved into someone who learns to live with mystery, uncertainty, and genuine human connection. However, this is not a simple redemption or growth arc; it's a **Disillusionment-to-Acceptance arc** where Maya must abandon her core belief system (that sufficient understanding and control can prevent tragedy) and discover that wisdom lies not in mastery but in surrender.\n\nAt the story's beginning, Maya is a high-functioning isolate who has weaponized her analytical mind against her own emotional life. She sees her ability to compartmentalize trauma as strength; she views her solitude as self-protection; she believes that if she can just understand the patterns deeply enough, she can prevent loss and reshape reality toward safety. The discovery of her probability-timeline abilities initially *validates* this worldview\u2014here, finally, is proof that reality is comprehensible and malleable. But as the story progresses, Maya confronts a devastating truth: having infinite choices doesn't create meaning; it creates paralysis. Seeing all possible timelines doesn't prevent tragedy; it multiplies it infinitely. The gift she thought would answer her existential questions instead amplifies them. This is the crucible of her transformation.\n\nMaya's arc moves through four distinct phases: **Denial** (The Glitch, In the Garden\u2014she attempts to rationalize her abilities as malfunction or delusion), **Seduction** (The Split, The Meeting\u2014Dr. Venn's offer tempts her with the promise that her gift can be weaponized for good, that control is possible), **Crisis** (The Meeting's aftermath and beyond\u2014she must choose between using her power to resurrect her father or accepting that some timelines should remain untouched), and **Integration** (Act 3\u2014she learns to live with her abilities not as a tool for control but as a lens for understanding the preciousness of singular choices). The mysterious child serves as her emotional anchor and moral mirror throughout; protecting this child forces Maya to confront that love and connection are not weaknesses to be eliminated but the only antidotes to meaninglessness. By the arc's end, Maya doesn't master her abilities\u2014she accepts them. She doesn't resurrect her father\u2014she grieves him properly, perhaps for the first time. She doesn't reshape reality\u2014she learns to navigate it with humility and wonder rather than control and fear.\n\nThis arc is specifically designed to challenge Maya's core identity as a compartmentalizer and control-seeker. Her transformation is not about becoming more emotional or abandoning logic; it's about integrating her analytical mind with her capacity for wonder, her need for control with her capacity for surrender, her terror of meaninglessness with the discovery that meaning emerges through connection, not comprehension.\n\n---\n\n## STRUCTURED DATA\n\n```json",
