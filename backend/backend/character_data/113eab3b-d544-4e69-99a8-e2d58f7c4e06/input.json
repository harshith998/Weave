Maya looks out at the city with new understanding. She can see the faint shimmer of branching probabilities in everyday moments, but she's no longer running from them. Aria holds her hand.

The visual style blends contemporary urban environments with magical realism elements. When probability timelines are visible, they're shown through subtle visual layering, chromatic aberration, and multiple exposure effects rather than obvious sci-fi artificiality. The color palette shifts from cool blues and grays in corporate/threatening scenes to warm oranges and greens in intimate/hopeful moments. The cinematography emphasizes natural light, reflections, and the play of light through water and glass to represent the fluidity of reality. Characters move naturally without exaggerated animation\u2014this is grounded, intimate filmmaking with profound visual metaphors.",
